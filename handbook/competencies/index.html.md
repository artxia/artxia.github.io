## Intro

GitLab has competencies as a common framework to learn things.
The competencies include both general and role specific compentencies.
Competencies are useful to have a [Single Source of Truth (SSoT)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html#why-a-single-source-of-truth) for: 

## Principles

1. Re-use the same materials for different audiences by having them on a competency page.
1. Accessible to everyone in the world, including doing the test and receiving the certification (via Google forms and Zapier)
1. Work handbook first so [everyone can contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/strategy/#mission)

## Usage

The following initiatives should use the same competencies as their SSoT.
Instead of maintaining separete materials they should link back to /handbook/competencies/name_of_competency
For example more we should have one SSoT for how to articulate the value of GitLab.

1. The [leadership forum](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/leadership-forum/) is organized by L&D
1. Maybe we can also do about 5 questions (with example of a good answer/level) per level
