## Introduction

Welcome to the Learning & Development (L&D) page at GitLab! L&D is an essential part of any organization's growth, success and overall business strategy. We want to support the growth of our GitLab team-members' competencies, skills and knowledge by providing them with the tools they need and also the opportunities to progress their own personal and professional development.  

## GitLab Learning & Development Principles

1. **Meaningful and relevant content.** We deliver learning solutions that drive the development and growth of team members throughout their life cycle at GitLab.
1. **Values aligned.** Our learning solutions reinforce GitLabâ€™s values, and foster continuous learning and curiosity.
1. **Diverse approaches to learning.** We apply a blended learning model for learning solutions, and adapt to various learning needs.
1. **Community.** We make our L&D offerings available to the public, aligned to our mission that everyone can contribute.

## Learning Sessions

### Live Learning
Live Learning sessions will be conducted on a monthly basis. There will be a Zoom video conference set up for each session. Official dates and topics will be added to the [schedule](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-sessions/#live-learning-schedule) as confirmed.

Format for 25 minute sessions:
* 10 minutes - introduction/content
* 10-15 minutes - Q&A

Format for 50 minute sessions:
* 10 minutes - introduction/content
* 20 minutes - breakout session
* 15 minutes - debrief
* 5 minutes - conclusion  

### Action Learning
[Action Learning](https://wial.org/action-learning/) sessions are designed to give team members a place to practice coaching skills by helping others work through specific challenges. Official dates and topics will be added to the [schedule](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/learning-sessions/#action-learning-schedule) as confirmed.

Format for 25 minute sessions:
* 3 minutes - introduction
* 20 minutes - open up for attendees to present a current challenge they are facing. [Note: Other participants ask open ended questions about the challenge. No leading questions or advise is to be given. Once the person with the challenge feels they have received enough coaching, the group works on another participant's challenge
* 2 minutes - conclusion

### Leadership Forum

An [overview](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/leadership-forum/#overview) about the format as well as topics and dates can be found on the [Leadership Forum](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/leadership-forum/) handbook page.

## Certifications

We provide our team members with certifications to demonstrate their knowledge on specific topics. We have [outlined](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/certifications/) our current list of certifications.

## Career Development

Everyone's career development is different, but we have [outlined](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/career-development/) what it can look like at GitLab.

## Language Courses

If you have any language courses you would like to recommend or links to websites please add them to this section.

 - [The 8 Best Interactive Websites for Adults to Learn English](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/best-websites-to-learn-english/)

There is also a way to practice foreign languages and ask for advice in several Slack channels, each dedicated to a specific language. You can find all these channels by searching for channels starting with #lang. If you're missing a channel for your target language, feel free to create one and mention it in #company-announcements so that fellow GitLab team-members can join too!

## New Manager Enablement Program

GitLab has a growing [resource](/handbook/people-group/learning-and-development/manager-development/) to enable all team members transitioning to a manager role. It contains a link to a checklist, readings, and a form to help learning and development customize your development as a manager.

## Learning Management Systems

We are currently evaluating different learning management systems (LMS) to provide growth opportunities in a more structured, on-demand format. To help us continue to be [Handbook First](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first), course content should be structured in the following way:

- Text in handbook
- Video on Youtube
- Test and certification in an open source platform or something without a price per user/student so we can invite all our million of users without incremental costs.
- Don't put text or video in the platform itself, only link to the handbook and video, so we  have a [single source of truth](/handbook/handbook-usage/#style-guide-and-information-architecture) and don't end up with duplicate content that is hard to keep up to date.

## Performance Indicators

### Engagement Survey Growth and Development Score > X%

Questions related to growth and development on the semi-annual [Engagement Survey](/handbook/people-operations/engagement/) have a favorable score. The exact target is to be determined.

### Rate of internal job promotions > X%

Total number of [promotions](/handbook/people-operations/promotions-transfers/) in a rolling six month period/total number of employees. The target for this is to be determined.

### 12 month voluntary team member turnover related to growth < X%
This is calculated the same as [12 month voluntary team member turnover KPI](/handbook/people-operations/people-operations-metrics/#team-member-turnover) but is using the number of team members actively choosing to leave GitLab to growth and development related reasons only. The target is to be determined.
