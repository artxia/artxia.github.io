The content marketing team is responsible for strategic content creation. The goal
of the content marketing team is to build an engaged audience of people who exhibit
specific, desirable behaviors (e.g. willingness to share personal data) through
repeatable and scalable content programs.

The content marketing team's focus is on creating end-to-end content experiences
that bring continued and consistent value to our audience. We value quality over
quantity and seek to deliver content that is backed by research, is useful, and actionable.



## Pillar process

## What is a content pillar?

A content pillar is a go to market content strategy that is aligned to a high-level theme (for example, Just Commit) and executed via sets. Often, content pillars are defined based on [value drivers and customer use cases](/handbook/marketing/#Go_to_market:_value_drivers and_customer_use_cases)in order to support go to market strategy. For example, "Just commit to application modernization" is a content pillar about improving application infrastructure in order to deploy faster. Within this pillar, many topics can be explored (CI/CD, cloud native, DevOps automation, etc.) and the story can be adapted to target different personas or verticals.  

We use content pillars to plan our work so we can provide great digital experiences to our audiences. The content team aligns to themes to ensure we are executing strategically and meeting business goals. Pillars allow us to narrow in on a specific topic and audience, and sets help us break our work into more manageable components. Each set created should produce an end-to-end content experience (awareness to decision) for our audience.

## Planning timeline

Pillar strategy is planned annually and reviewed quarterly. Content sets are planned quarterly and reviewed monthly. When planning, we follow the 80/20 rule: 80% of capacity is planned leaving 20% unplanned to react to last minute opportunities.

- **2 weeks prior to start of the quarter:** Proposed content plans are published to the content schedule. Product marketing, digital marketing, and corporate events marketing give feedback on the plan.
- **1 week prior to the start of the quarter:** Kickoff calls are held.
- **1st day of the quarter:** Content plans are finalized.
- **1st of each month:** Progress reviews are held. Plans are adjusted if needed.
- **Last day of the quarter:** Cross-functional retrospective is held.
