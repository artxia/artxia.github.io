## Updating

1. This page is the list of [KPIs](/handbook/ceo/kpis/) and links to the definitions in the handbook.
1. In order to maintain a [SSOT](/handbook/handbook-usage/#style-guide-and-information-architecture), KPI definitions live only in the functional section in the handbook, as close to the work as possible. So define performance indicators in the relevant page (for example the adoption page that also contains how the team works and has relevant videos) instead of a (K)PI page.
1. The Data Team is responsible for maintaining this page.
1. If a KPI is not defined or is being updated, create a MR to propose or update a definition and ask the appropriate business stakeholder to review and merge.
1. If you remove, add, or change the essence of a KPI, the merge request needs to be approved by the function head and the CEO. Last person approving should merge the MR.
1. Tag the CFO; function head; Manager, Data; and Manager, FP&A in the MR for visibility into downstream changes that may need to occur.
1. Once the MR is merged, the author makes an announcement on the Company Call, along with the link to the Merge Request.
1. FP&A will add an * for the definition change to the Investor Metrics along with a link to the Merge Request that describes the change.
1. If the KPI being changed is one of the following, the CFO will need to notify investors and any relevant external parties:

    - [Net Retention](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#retention-and-reasons-for-churn)
    - [Gross Retention](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#retention-and-reasons-for-churn)
    - [ARR](/handbook/sales/#annual-recurring-revenue-arr)

## Working with the Data Team

Please see [the Data Team Handbook](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/).

## Legend

ðŸ“Š indicates that the KPI is operational and is embedded in the handbook.

ðŸ”— indicates that the KPI is operational and linked from the handbook.

ðŸš§ can be used to indicate that the KPI is being *actively worked on*. When using this indicator, an issue should also be linked from this page.

### Progress

The Data team is continuously working to make sure there's full coverage on all KPIs. KPI must be [fully defined](/handbook/ceo/kpis/#parts-of-a-kpi) with the data source available in the Data warehouse to be prioritized. 
The Manager, Data produces a monthly update in the [Data team project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues) on the last Wednesday of every month using the [KPI Status](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/KPI%20Status%20Monthly%20Report%20Template.md) template.

Most recent update: 2020-02-26

## GitLab Metrics

We share a spreadsheet with investors called "GitLab Metrics."
The GitLab Metrics Sheet should be a subset of the KPIs listed on this page. 
Alternatively, the sheet may show variations or subsets of one of those KPIs, such as showing all licensed users and then licensed users by product. 

## Satisfaction

We do satisfaction scope on a scale of 1 to 5 how satisfied people are with the experience.
We donâ€™t use NPS since that cuts off certain scores and we want to preserve fidelity.
We have the following abbreviation letter before SAT, please donâ€™t use SAT without letter before to specify it:

- I = [Interviewee](/handbook/hiring/metrics/#interviewee-satisfaction-isat) (would you recommend applying here)
- L = [Leadership](/handbook/eba/#leadership-sat-survey) (as an executive with dedicated administrative support, how is your executive administrative support received)
- O = [Onboarding](/handbook/people-group/people-operations-metrics/#onboarding-tsat) (how was your onboarding experience)
- P = [Product](/handbook/product/metrics/#paid-net-promoter-score) (would you recommend GitLab the product)
- S = [Support](/handbook/support/#support-satisfaction-ssat) (would you recommend our support followup)
- T = Team-members (would you recommend working here)
- C = unused since customer is ambiguous (can mean product or support, not all users are customers)
- E = unused since employee is used by other companies but not by us

## Retention

Since we track retention in a lot of ways, we should never refer to just "Retention" without indicating what kind of retention.
We track:

* [Net Retention](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#retention-and-reasons-for-churn)
* [Gross Retention](/handbook/customer-success/vision/#retention-and-reasons-for-churn)
* User Retention
* [Team Member Retention](/handbook/people-group/people-group-metrics/#team-member-retention)
