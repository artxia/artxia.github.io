## Accessing Sisense

Everyone at GitLab has View-only access to [Sisense](https://app.periscopedata.com/app). Log in using [Okta](/handbook/business-ops/okta/). If you need elevated access, such as Editor permissions to create your own charts, create an [access request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/issues/new?issuable_template=New+Access+Request). Also see the [user roles section](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/periscope#user-roles)

## <i class="fas fa-chart-pie fa-fw icon-color font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i>Self-Serve Analysis in Sisense
The goal of this section is to empower the reader to build their own Sisense dashboards that answer their questions about GitLab data. The examples given at the end are specific to the Product organization but are generalizable to any other team at GitLab.

### Sisense Basics
The first step to building your own Sisense dashboard is checking that you have the correct permissions.

After logging in to Sisense using Okta, you should see a `New Chart` button in the top right corner. If you don’t see anything, you only have View-only access and you should follow the instructions above to gain Editor access.

Once you can see `New Chart`, you can start creating your own dashboards! Find `Dashboards` on the left side nav bar and click the + icon to build one. Make sure to give it a name in order to keep our directory organized.

Once your dashboard is built and named, you can start adding charts by clicking `New Chart` in the top right. Now you’re ready to start writing queries.

### Finding the Right Data Sources
The next step to answering your data question is finding the relevant table(s) to query from. This requires knowing some background about our Snowflake data warehouse and the data sources which feed into it. There are 3 general types of data that we store in Snowflake: External, Internal Frontend, and Internal Backend.

##### External Data
External data is all of the data generated by third-party software we use at GitLab, but don’t store the production data ourselves. These sources include Salesforce, Zuora, Netsuite, Greenhouse, and BambooHR. We load this data into our data warehouse using APIs.

##### Internal Backend Data
GitLab.com is a Ruby on Rails app using a Postgres database on the backend. Each time a user on GitLab.com creates a new MR, issue, comment, milestone, etc., they create a new row in the database. The data team has written custom ELT to sync these Postgres tables into our data warehouse where they’re scrubbed for PII and made available to analyze.

For self-managed instances, we try to get weekly anonymized summaries of these backend databases using usage ping.

##### Internal Frontend Data
Additionally, we’ve enabled a tool called [Snowplow](https://snowplowanalytics.com) to track frontend interactions on gitlab.com. Snowplow has automatic page view tracking as well as form and link-click tracking. Snowplow sends metadata along with every event, including information about the user’s session and browser.

Note: Snowplow is also capable of capturing backend events but at the moment we’re primarily using it for javascript (frontend) tracking.
{: .alert .alert-info}

What’s the difference between frontend and backend data? Backend data is data that’s already being preserved in the application database because it serves some purpose for the application (MRs, issues, pipelines). In contrast, the primary purpose of frontend tracking is analytics.

<div class="panel panel-success">
**dbt Documentation**
{: .panel-heading}
<div class="panel-body">
Our [dbt Docs site](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/) lists all of the tables available for querying in snowflake. Many of these are documented at both the table and column level, making it a great starting point for writing a query.
</div>
</div>

### Examples

**Question 1: How many GitLab.com users visit the preferences page every day?**  
We can use internal frontend data to answer this question since we're asking about page views. We can query Snowplow page views with like this:

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', page_view_start)::DATE AS period,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_snowplow_domain_id) AS "Count Users"
FROM analytics.snowplow_page_views_all
WHERE page_url LIKE '%/profile/preferences%'
  AND page_view_start > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_DATE) -- Last 7 days
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

Running this query in Sisense’s SQL editor will output a table in the chart section below the query. From there, Sisense offers you a variety of options for visualizing your data. A great way to learn about building charts is to watch this 10-minute [Data Onboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4FwRcKb95w&feature=youtu.be) video from Sisense.

**Question 2: How many GitLab.com users create a merge request every month?**  
We can use internal backend data to answer this question since merge requests are stored in GitLab.com's backend database.

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', merge_request_created_at)::DATE AS period,
  COUNT(DISTINCT author_id) AS "Count Users"
FROM analytics.gitlab_dotcom_merge_requests_xf
WHERE merge_request_created_at BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-06-01'
  AND merge_request_created_at < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) -- Don't show current month
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

This shows that about 110K users create a merge request every month.

**Question 3: How many "users" convert from one trial form to another in the last 30 days? (Conversion Funnel)**  
We can use snowplow CTEs to query the two steps seperately, then join them together.

```sql
WITH first_trial_form AS (
  SELECT
    domain_userid         AS user_id,
    derived_tstamp::DATE  AS day_of,
    derived_tstamp        AS sent_at
  FROM analytics.snowplow_unnested_events_30 -- Change `_30` to `_all` if needed. For a custom date range, filter on derived_tstamp: `WHERE derived_tstamp BETWEEN '2019-10-01' AND '2019-12-01'
  WHERE event_name = 'page_view'
    AND page_url = 'https://gitlab.com/-/trials/new'
),
second_trial_form AS (
  SELECT
    domain_userid         AS user_id,
    derived_tstamp::DATE  AS day_of,
    derived_tstamp        AS sent_at
  FROM analytics.snowplow_unnested_events_30
  WHERE event = 'unstruct'
    AND event_name = 'submit_form'
    AND page_url = 'https://gitlab.com/-/trials/apply'
)
SELECT
  first_trial_form.day_of,
  COUNT(DISTINCT first_trial_form.user_id)   AS "View first trial form",
  COUNT(DISTINCT second_trial_form.user_id)  AS "Submit last trial form",
  COUNT(DISTINCT second_trial_form.user_id) * 100 / COUNT(DISTINCT first_trial_form.user_id) AS "Pct"
FROM first_trial_form
  LEFT JOIN second_trial_form
    ON first_trial_form.user_id = second_trial_form.user_id
    AND first_trial_form.day_of = second_trial_form.day_of
    AND first_trial_form.sent_at <= second_trial_form.sent_at
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

**Question 4: Which "status" tabs ('Open', 'Merged', etc) get clicked on the /merge_requests page?**  
Similar to before, we can use snowplow data to measure the clicks and page views on the merge_requests page.

```sql
WITH link_clicks AS (
  SELECT
    TRY_PARSE_JSON(unstruct_event):"data":"data":"elementId"::VARCHAR AS element_id
  FROM analytics.snowplow_unnested_events_30
  WHERE event_name = 'link_click'
    AND element_id IN ('state-closed', 'state-all', 'state-opened', 'state-merged')
    AND page_urlpath LIKE '%/merge_requests'
)

SELECT
  element_id AS "Tab Name",
  COUNT(*)                                             AS "Total Clicks",
  COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM link_clicks) * 100  AS "Percent of Clicks"
FROM link_clicks
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

| Tab Name     | Total Clicks | Percent of Clicks | 
|--------------|--------------|-------------------| 
| state-merged | 200923       | 65.304300         | 
| state-opened | 50291        | 16.345700         | 
| state-closed | 31957        | 10.386700         | 
| state-all    | 24501        | 7.963400          | 

Of all the clicks on these 4 tabs, 65% are to the "Merged" tab.

If we wanted to know how often these tabs are clicked *as a percentage of total page views* to the merge requests page, we would make a few modifications to the query:
```sql
WITH link_clicks AS (
  SELECT
    TRY_PARSE_JSON(unstruct_event):"data":"data":"elementId"::VARCHAR AS element_id,
    COUNT(*)                                                          AS total_clicks
  FROM analytics.snowplow_unnested_events_30
  WHERE event_name = 'link_click'
    AND element_id IN ('state-closed', 'state-all', 'state-opened', 'state-merged')
    AND page_urlpath LIKE '%/merge_requests'
  GROUP BY 1
),

page_views AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_views
  FROM analytics.snowplow_unnested_events_30
  WHERE event = 'page_view'
    AND page_urlpath LIKE '%/merge_requests'
)

SELECT
  link_clicks.element_id                                  AS "Tab Name",
  link_clicks.total_clicks / page_views.total_views * 100 AS "Percent of Page Views"
FROM link_clicks
  INNER JOIN page_views
    ON 1=1
```

| Tab Name     | Percent of Page Views | 
|--------------|-----------------------| 
| state-merged | 5.423417              | 
| state-opened | 1.357480              | 
| state-closed | 0.862600              | 
| state-all    | 0.661344              | 

5 percent of page views on the merge requests page result in a click to the "Merged" tab. 

### Sisense chart performance 
If the Sisense chart has timed-out or is taking a long time to run, most likely, the SQL query used to generate the Sisense chart needs to be refactored for query optimization. Please [create an issue in the Data Team project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/new) for help. 

## Official Badge for a Dashboard
Some dashboards in Sisense will include an Official Badge (similar to Twitter's Verified Checkmark).
![Sisense Verified Checkmark](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/periscope/periscope_verified_checkmark.jpg)

That means these analyses have been reviewed by the data team for query accuracy.
Dashboards without the verified checkmark are not necessarily inaccurate;
they just haven't been reviewed by the data team.
Only members of the Data role can add or remove the Official Badge.


## Spaces
We have one Sisense [space](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/spaces#article-title):
* GitLab

They connect to the data warehouse with different users- `periscope` and `periscope_sensitive` respectively.

Most work is present in the GitLab space, though some _extremely sensitive analyses_ will be limited to GitLab sensitive.
Examples of this may include analyses involving contractor and employee compensation and unanonymized interviewing data.

Spaces are organized with tags. Tags should map to function (Product, Marketing, Sales, etc) and subfunction (Create, Secure, Field Marketing, EMEA).
Tags should loosely match [issue labels](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#issue-labeling) (no prioritization).
Tags are free. Make it as easy as possible for people to find the information they're looking for. At this time, tags cannot be deleted or renamed.

## Pushing Dashboards into Slack Automatically

Many folks will have some cadence on which they want to see dashboards;
for example, Product wants an update on opportunities lost of product reasons every week.
Where it is best that this info is piped into Slack on a regular cadence, you can take advantage of Slack's native `/remind` to print the URL.
If it does not appear that the dashboard is autorefreshing, please ping a [Sisense admin](/handbook/business-ops/#tech-stack) to update the refresh schedule.

## <i class="fas fa-users fa-fw icon-color font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i>User Roles

There are three user roles (Access Levels) in Sisense: admin, SQL, and View Only.

The current status of Sisense licenses can be found in [the analytics project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/analyze/periscope_users.yml).

<div class="panel panel-info">

```


</div>
</div>

### Administrators

These users have the ability to provision new users, change permissions, and edit database connections. (Typical admin things)

Resource: [Onboarding Admins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-cZgf6zzlQ&feature=youtu.be)

### Editor access

The users have the ability to write SQL queries against the `analytics` and `analytics_staging` schemas of the `analytics` database that underlie charts and dashboards. They can also create or utilize SQL snippets to make this easier. **There are a limited number of SQL access licenses, so at this time we aim to limit teams to one per Director-led team. It will be up to the Director to decide on the best candidate on their team to have SQL access.**

### View-only users

These users can consume all existing dashboards. They can change filters on dashboards. Finally, they can take advantage of the [Drill Down](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/drilldowns) functionality to dig into dashboards.

### Functional Group Users

We have additional roles for further subdividing the Editor role. Certain charts should not be able to be edited by anyone. For example, the [Finance KPIs](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/483606/) dashboard should only be able to be edited by members of the Data and Finance roles.

### Notes for when provisioning users

All users have View-only access privileges via Okta.

To upgrade a user, in the Sisense UI, navigate to the **Roles and Policies** section. Then add the user to the relevant group (Admin/Editor) and their functional group (e.g. Marketing, Product, etc.).

Users will inherit the highest access from any group they are in. This is why all functions are by default View-only.

## New Dashboard Creation and Review Workflow

This section details the workflow of how to push a dashboard to "production" in Sisense. Currently, there is no functionality to have a MR-first workflow. This workflow is intended to ensure a high level of quality of all dashboards within the company. A dashboard is ready for production when the visuals, SQL, Python, and UX of the dashboard have been peer reviewed by a member of the Data Team and meet the standards detailed in the handbook.

1. Create a dashboard with `WIP:` as the name and add it to the `WIP` [topic](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/topic/WIP/aba9378487ff48cf8b6e1c5413f8a7e6)
1. Utilize the documentation of [dbt](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com) and the warehouse to build your queries and charts
1. Once the dashboard is ready for review, create an MR [in the data team project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics) using the Sisense Dashboard Review template. You do not need to make any changes, and this *should* be an empty MR.
1. Follow the instructions on the template
1. Assign the template to a member of the data team for review. If you don't know who to ping, use `@gitlab-data`.
1. Once all feedback has been given and applied, the data team member will update the text tile in the upper right corner detailing who created and reviewed the dashboard, when it was last updated, and cross-link relevant issues (See [Data Analysis Process](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#-data-analysis-process) for more details)
1. The data team member reviewer will:
   * Rename the dashboard to remove the `WIP:` label
   * Remove the dashboard from the `WIP` topic
   * Add the Approval Badge to the dashboard
   * Merge the MR if they have permissions or assign it to someone with merge rights
      * MR's can also be closed if there are no meaningful changes. In that case, the data team reviewer will add the label `Approved` to the MR before closing it

## Update to Existing Dashboard Workflow

This section details the workflow on how to make updates to existing dashboards that have already been through the Data Team Peer Review process. Once a dashboard is in production, incremental additions to the dashboard can be implemented by the Data Analyst and the DRI/Prioritization Owner without going through the entire New Dashboard Creation and Review Workflow. Please follow the below steps to update an exisiting dashboard.

1. Add `WIP:` to the title of the chart being updated. If a new chart is being added, add `WIP:` to the title.
1. Make changes to the existing chart or add a new chart in accordance with the SQL style guide and Sisense visualization best practices set forth in the New Dashboard Creation and Review Workflow.
1. Once the dashboard is ready for review by the DRI/Prioritization Owner, create a MR [in the data team project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics) using the Sisense Dashboard Review template. Ask the DRI/Prioritization Owner to complete their section of the MR located at the top. The Data Analyst should complete the Update to Existing Dashboard only section.
1. After the Business Stakeholder/DRI reviews and approves the update and you have completed the Update to Existing Dashboard checklist, you can remove the `WIP:` from the new or updated chart and close the MR.

## Requesting Automatic Dashboard Refresh

You can request for an [automatic dashboard refresh](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/dashboard-refresh) by [creating a Data team project issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=&issuable_template=periscope_dashboard_refresh). You can use the issue template to request an automatic refresh over a specified interval for one specific dashboard or a bulk list of dashboards.


## <i class="far fa-object-group fa-fw icon-color font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i>Embedding Sisense Charts in the Handbook

The business unit, not the data team, is responsible for embedding these charts in the handbook.
Sisense has great [embed docs](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/embed-api) and chat support through the app. There are three main ways to embed charts or dashboard in our handbook.

### Hardcoded HTML

You can always hardcode HTML in any file type that accepts it. `.html` files are the obvious example. But markdown (`.md`) and embedded ruby (`.erb`) files also allow fallback to regular HTML.

#### Dashboards

It is quite easy to embed a whole dashboard in the handbook. 
To embed a dashboard, you must first make it an [Externally Shared Dashboard](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/share-dashboards#CreateShare).
Then, you can add `?embed=true` to the URL string to make it an embed link. 
Plug the URL into the following:
```
<iframe class="dashboard-embed" src="https://app.periscopedata.com/shared/string-of-numbers-here?embed=true" height="700"> </iframe>
```

We aim to make sure that the dashboard does not require scroll within the handbook, so you will need to adjust the height value appropraitely. 
There is no way to do that programmatically. 

#### Charts
Embedded charts in the handbook should always be generated using the `signed_periscope_url` helper function. This function will generate a signed URL for you automatically without needing a member of the data team to help you. This is especially convenient when experimenting with passing different data options to the Sisense API.

Note that your file must end in `.erb`. If you are working on a file which has a name `index.html.md` simply append `.erb` to create a filename of `index.html.md.erb`. 

You simply pass the data as argument to the function. It can take any data required by the Sisense API, including sub-arrays and objects. The Sisense documentation has a [full list of options available for the embed API](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/embed-api-options).

```
<embed width="100%" height="100%" src="<%= signed_periscope_url(chart: 6114177, dashboard: 463858, embed: 'v2') %>">
```

This method does not work in plain Markdown or HTML files because they do not execute code when rendering.

### Performance Indicators YML

`data/performance_indicators.yml` is the basis for a system that automatically generates handbook pages with performance indicator content on them, according to a convention. If you give an object the `periscope_data` property with sub-values, the template will automatically generate a signed URL and write the HTML for you. It uses the same helper function as above.

```
- name: MR Rate
  description: MR Rate is a monthly evaluation of how MRs on average an Development engineer performs.
  periscope_data:
    chart: 6114177
    dashboard: 463858
    embed: v2
  is_key: true
```

## Adding data *into* Sisense through CSV or Google Sheets
There are a couple ways to upload data into Sisense through CSVs. All of these methods are documented and can be requested through [creating a data team project issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=&issuable_template=CSV%20or%20GSheets%20Data%20Upload). Please click on the link to review your options. 

If you still decide to [upload your CSV through Sisense](https://dtdocs.sisense.com/article/csv-upload), ensure that you are using the `Snowflake` database in the `New Chart` or `New Exploration` window. Otherwise, you should always default to `GitLab_(Use_this_one!)` to access the internal GitLab data models. Please see image below to understand how to change databases in Sisense: 
![Sisense Databases](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/periscope/sisense_csv_upload_database.jpg)


Please remember not to upload personal or sensitive data into Sisense through the [Sisense CSV Upload functionality](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/csv-upload) since this data will be publicly accessible by all GitLab team members. 


## Pulling data *out* of Sisense

There may be times in which you need to pull data out of Sisense. 
If this is a one-off case, you can always download a CSV from the UI. Please note that the [CSV download](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/csv-download) has a maximum size of 500MB and the query must complete within 4 minutes.
If you need to regularly pull this data into, for example, a sheet, you can explose the CSV's public URL by going to Edit > Chart Format > Advanced > Expose Public CSV URL.
Then in the sheet you can use `=importdata("PUBLICURLHERE")`

If the data you are trying to export is not sensitive, is larger than 500MB in size but less than a million rows, then [create a data team project issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/new?issue%5Bassignee_id%5D=&issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=&issuable_template=Data%20Download%20Request). 

If you need to tool to manipulate text files, please consider [this list of command line tools for manipulating structured text data](https://github.com/dbohdan/structured-text-tools#dsv) or [these great resources](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20848581).  

## <i class="far fa-lightbulb fa-fw icon-color font-awesome" aria-hidden="true"></i>Tips and Tricks

#### Having a Dashboard that only presents the correct fiscal quarter information

You may want a dashboard that only filters to the current fiscal quarter or the next fiscal quarter. Sisense's off-the-shelf date filters cannot accomodate for custom fiscal years.

In your analysis, add the following: (update the `[datevalue]` with the date you're looking to have filtered)
```
LEFT JOIN analytics.date_details on current_date = date_actual
WHERE [datevalue] < last_day_of_fiscal_quarter
AND [datevalue] > first_day_of_fiscal_quarter
```

#### Filter out current month in dashboard queries

In most cases, you need to filter out the current month from your query and only report on completed months.
The current month is incomplete and showing these numbers can be misleading.
Please use the below statement in your dashboard query to filter out current month.

```
WHERE <month_column> < date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
```

#### Timezones

All timestamps in Snowflake [should be in UTC](/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#timezones).

Sisense's [display time](https://doc.periscopedata.com/article/preferences-menu#Timezone) is set to PT (Pacific Time). This is aligned with the [communication guidelines](/handbook/communication/#writing-style-guidelines).

When using `[created_date=daterange]` Sisense uses the current_timestamp and converts it to PT for the comparison. For example, if on October 4th at 13:00 PT (20:00 UTC), you request data from the past 3 days, then Sisense will make the filter from  2019-10-02 07:00:00.000 to 2019-10-05 07:00:00.000. These times are in UTC and correspond to midnight at the start of 2019-10-02 in PT and midnight at the end of 2019-10-04 in PT - i.e. this is 3 full days for PT. If the database stores the values in UTC (which we do), then the comparison is exactly what you want. 

The main thing you should worry about as an end-user is formatting the date for display in the chart. This can be done simply by converting the timestamp to PT with this syntax `[created_at:pst]`. You can also convert it to a date by appending `:date` like so `[created_at:pst:date]`. This is necessary when comparing dates in a source system such as Salesforce to what you see in Sisense.

The key things to remember are:
* Unless otherwise specified or declared, all dates from the database and in your queries will be in UTC
* The daterange filter in Sisense is based on Pacific time

#### Working with Date Range Filters

When you have an aggregated date that you want to use as a filter on a dashboard, you have to use the aggregated period as the `date range start` and one day less than the end of the aggregation as the `date range end` value.
Your date range start value can be mapped to your date period.

For the date range end, you need to create an additional column in your query to automatically calculate the end date based on the value selected in your aggregation filter. If we've been using `sfdc_opportunity_xf.close_date` as the date we care about, here is an example: `dateadd(day,-1,dateadd([aggregation],1,[sfdc_opportunity_xf.close_date:aggregation]))  as date_period_end`
Then add the mapping for the date range end.

#### Finding where a specific model is queried

All queries used to generate charts and snippets can be found in the [periscope/master](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/periscope/tree/periscope/master) branch of the [Sisense](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/periscope) project. 
Enter your model or keyword of interest in the [search field](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=&group_id=&project_id=11096787&search_code=true&repository_ref=periscope%2Fmaster&nav_source=navbar) to find relevant queries.

#### Avoid unclear Visualizations

Pie charts are universally seen as a poor method of visualizing data. Read [this blog post](https://medium.com/@KristinHenry/in-defense-of-pie-charts-and-why-you-shouldnt-use-them-df2e8ccb5f76) as a primer on why not to use pie charts.


### High-Quality Image Exports

When exporting static charts out of Sisense, use the built-in export functionality instead of taking a screenshot. Exporting produces a higher-quality image with a transparent background. To export an image out of Persicope, select `More Options` in the top-right corner of any chart and then select `Download Image`.

### Sisense Housekeeping

Sisense operates as our Business Intelligence Tool and our Single Source of Truth. As our SSOT, Sisense requires us to maintain a very high level of cleanliness, tidiness, and accuracy.

It also requires that the dashboards created and/or approved by the data team are accurate and informative.
It also requires some periodic maintenance from the data team members.

Main Principles:

- All approved dashboards have to work (charts are all displaying) and show accurate data.
- All WIP dashboards created by Data team members have to be **Work in Progress**. That means the project is still ongoing and someone on the team is still planning to release this dashboard.
- We don't keep empty dashboards
- We don't keep untitled dashboards
- We don't keep dashboards which have SQL errors: either we fix the error or we archive the dashboard

#### Auto-archival of unused dashboards

At the moment, for all dashboards, the auto-archival feature is enabled. That means that if a dashboard is not viewed for more than 45 days, it will be automatically archived. An archived dashboard is not deleted and can be unarchived.

#### Monthly Sisense Cleanup

Entropy is a natural but avoidable state of a Business Intelligence Tool. In order to act against this tendency, the Data Team operates periodic Maintenance Operations in our Sisense space.

Every month, a Data Team member will take care of the maintenance. This could be proactively claimed one week before the end of each month during one of the Data Ops meetings.

The maintenance task has to be completed in the first week of every month. To do so, you have to open a new issue in the data team project and select the Sisense Cleanup Issue templace. This template will give a list of tasks to complete. Once all of them are completed, you can close the issue.
