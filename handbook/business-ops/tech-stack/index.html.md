### Standard Object Definitions

#### Lead
A lead is a prospect who has yet to be qualified. Lead may have expressed interest by requesting contact, starting a trial, attending a webinar or trade show, or registering on GitLab.com or our customer portal. Leads are typically followed up by our Sales Development Reps (SDR) or Account Executives. During this initial qualification process, a SDR will uncover certain details that will determine whether the prospect is qualified. For more information on the SDR Qualification process, [click here](/handbook/marketing/marketing-sales-development/sdr/#qualifying). Once qualified, the lead is converted into an Account, Contact, and Opportunity. For all non-marketing and non-system administrators of Salesforce, all leads are read-only.

#### Account
An account can either be a prospect who was qualified by a SDR or Account Executive, an existing customer, or a partner. Accounts will contain all company information, including billing and shipping address, company phone, website, support package, industry, employee count, and annual revenue. An account will be the parent record for associated contacts, opportunities, subscriptions, invoices, and payments.

#### Contact
A contact is a person associated to an account record. Information contained in the contact record include name, mailing address, title, role, phone, and email. An account can have many contacts associated to it. Contacts can be added to opportunities via [Contact Roles](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000005632&type=1&language=en_US).

#### Opportunity
An opportunity is created when a prospect has expressed interest in GitLab. The opportunity record includes information regarding close dates, contract value, and type. An opportunity will be in a certain stage, depending on where it is in the sales cycle. For more information on stages, [click here](/handbook/sales/#opportunity-stages).

#### Tasks and Events
Tasks and events are used when logging calls and meetings into Salesforce. Collectively called "activities", these records are meant to track interactions with customers and prospects. For example, you might create a task after you've attempted to call a prospect. You may also want to create a task as a reminder to complete a certain task, such as call a prospect or send an email. Tasks can also be created by external systems such as Marketo or Outreach when emails are sent to leads or contacts. External resources: [Difference Between a Task and an Event](https://success.salesforce.com/answers?id=90630000000gvEbAAI), [SFDC Task Documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=activities.htm&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.ph%2F&type=0)
