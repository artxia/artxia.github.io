#### Tech Stack Support Hierarchy
1. System Owners
1. IT Operations or People Operations

System owners will remain the point of contact for provisioning and issues involving administration. IT Operations engineering empowers system owners to maintain accountability for tech systems through efforts involving automation, monitoring, and visibility. People Operations Specialists supports the tech stack listed in the [People Operations Handbook](/handbook/tools-and-tips/).

#### Tech Stack Lists
* [Tech Stack Google Sheet:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mTNZHsK3TWzQdeFqkITKA0pHADjuurv37XMuHv12hDU/edit?usp=sharing) contains information about who the business owners, technical owners, provisioners, data gathered, etc
    * Tech Stack definitions: 
        * Business Owner: The Business Owner is responsible for all budget and decision making around the tool. They should define how the tool is used and by whom. This person usually has login access to the tool as `Owner` but login access isn't necessary in all cases.
        * Technical Owner: Are all the `administrators` of a tool. Everyone who has access to provision and deprovision access of a tool as well as the technical expertise needed to manage it. 
        * Provisioner/Deprovisioner: People in charge of granting and removing team member access to a tool. At least two provisioners/deprovisioners should be named for every tool in the handbook.
* [Tech Stack Overview:](/handbook/business-ops/tech-stack/) provides an overview of how GitLab uses the tool.
