## Role Entitlements for a specific job

The goal of baseline and role-based entitlements is to increase security while reducing access management complexity by moving towards role-based access control. The basic idea is that if we configure all of our systems for access based on the specific job families that require access to each system, then as we scale we can simply add new GitLab team-members to these pre-defined groups and system-level access will be granted automatically. Read more about this in the [Baseline Role-Based Entitlements Access Runbooks & Issue Templates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#baseline-role-based-entitlements-access-runbooks--issue-templates) section of the handbook.

Find a list of all our current role based entitlement in the [Access Request project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests#role-based-entitlements). 


### Instructions on how to create Role-Based Entitlement Templates.

Below is a summary of how to create new templates for a Role-Based Entitlement that does not have one. 

1. Pick a role that is somewhat similar to or look through the templates that already exist. [Issue Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates)

2. Then copy the Markdown and create a new file in the directory. [Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates)

3. Name it with _ instead of any spaces with the dept at the beginning like Eng_Backend_Engineer_Entitlements_Access_Request.

4. Update the copy to reflect their job title, systems, edit the bottom copy of tech stack provisioners and labels. (which you can assist with)

5. Once itâ€™s prepared, it will need to be reviewed by a manager and director in their department.
    * You will also need to include applicable System Admins/Provisioners for review. **System Admins/Provisioners will need to review and comment approval or denial within the request.**
    * Refer to [Baseline Role-Based Entitlements Access Runbooks & Issue Templates](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#baseline-role-based-entitlements-access-runbooks--issue-templates) for additional information. 

6. Then if the management comments their approval, it can be merged.

7. Add to README and AR handbook page.


## Frequently asked questions

#### So you need access to a system or a group/vault?
1. Choose a template based on your needs: most people use the [Bulk](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/issues/new?issuable_template=Bulk+Access+Request) or [Single Person](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/issues/new?issuable_template=Single+Person+Access+Request) templates.
1. Do not open an Access Request for anything that is part of a baseline entitlement unless it got missed during onboarding.
    1. [All team members baseline entitlements](/handbook/business-ops/it-ops-team/#baseline-entitlements)
    1. [Role-based baseline entitlements](/handbook/engineering/security/#baseline-role-based-entitlements-access-runbooks--issue-templates)
1. You must have the label `manager approved` on the issue **unless** the person is:
    1. an internal team member being added to a g-suite email alias or group
    1. an internal team member being added to a slack group
    1. a completely unchanged role based baseline entitlement
1. Make sure to assign the issue to the [people who provision access to the system.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mTNZHsK3TWzQdeFqkITKA0pHADjuurv37XMuHv12hDU/edit#gid=0)
1. If you need help, please ask IT-Ops in the slack channel #it-ops with a link to the issue you need help with.
1. Only ask for the least amount of access to do the work.
1. You don't need an AR for Zendesk light access. [Follow the instructions to get access by email.]((/handbook/support/internal-support/#light-agent-zendesk-accounts-available-for-all-gitlab-staff))

#### Do I need manager approval? Sometimes!
Not if this is a request for:

1. an internal team member being added to a g-suite email alias or group (unless that group provides permissions to Google Cloud Platform)
1. an internal team member being added to a slack group
1. something included in your role based entitlement

#### I need access to version.gitlab.com or license.gitlab.com
You might already have it: [Test if you have a dev account.](https://dev.gitlab.org/)
* If you need a dev account, open a [Single Person Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/issues/new?issuable_template=Single+Person+Access+Request).
* If you have a dev account, go to [license](https://license.gitlab.com/) and [version](https://version.gitlab.com/users/sign_in) and login with GitLab and authorize them to use your credentials.

#### I need access to Zendesk
You don't need to open an access request for Zendesk light access. [Follow the instructions to get access by email](/handbook/support/internal-support/#light-agent-zendesk-accounts-available-for-all-gitlab-staff)

#### I need to add an email alias, or name change.

Please see the G Suite alias request AR for any email alias additions or name changes. There are no restrictions on what can be requested, or how many, but please include a short explanation for the addition or change. Some alias requests may be denied if deemed inapproprite or at the discretion of operations. [System or Tool Specific Access Requests](/handbook/business-ops/it-ops-team/access-requests/#system-or-tool-specific)

## Instructions

### Instructions and Guidance for Managers
1. Issues should only be approved after carefully considering whether the requestor needs the permissions outlined. Every review should include a [least privilege review](/handbook/engineering/security/#principle-of-least-privilege)
1. Add your approval by adding the label `manager approved` and `ready for provisioning`.
1. If you do not approve, add a comment and close the issue.
1. If you are unsure whether the requestor needs the permissions outlined to fulfill their duties, mention `@gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance` in a comment for assistance

### Instructions and Guidance for Provisioners
1. Carefully review the rationale provided by the requestor to determine whether the access level is necessary or if a lower access level would be sufficient. Review the [Least Privilege](/handbook/engineering/security/#principle-of-least-privilege) write-up for guidance.
1. If manager approval is required for the request, verify the requester's manager has added the ~ManagerApproved label.
1. If the request involves access to critical Infrastructure systems, @ mention `Infrastructure-Managers` and ask them to approve by adding the ~InfrastructureApproved label.
1. If all necessary approvals have been granted, proceed with provisioning.
1. Edit the last column in the table to `yes` or `no` once you issue credentials/access or not, so it's clear you responded to the request.
1. If administrative access is being granted, mention `@gitlab-com/gl-security/secops` in a comment and add the label `admin-access` to this request so Security Operations knows who has admin access.
1. If requesting admin access, the system admin should additionally add the labels `SystemOwnerApproved` and `AdminLevelAccess` labels

## Access Request Template Instructions:

#### [Bulk Access Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/issues/new?issuable_template=Bulk%20Access%20Request)
*Do you have a bunch of people with the same manager to add to the same system/vault/group?*

> Note: Admin access cannot be granted by bulk, please open single person requests. There is one exception to this rule: bulk requests that include admin-level permissions can be used when it is for the correction or realignment of baseline role entitlements. In cases where a team's baseline entitlements must be realigned or corrected, a bulk access request can be sumitted if realigned entitlements include admin-level permissions.

#### Shared Account Access Request

All shared accounts must be managed via Okta. If 1password must be used (okta not technically possible), this needs to be outlined in the Access Request.

Prior to submitting this Issue Request, please review our [Access Control Policy and Procedures](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#access-control-policy-and-procedures) to ensure that your request is in line with GitLab's policies and procedures. If after review you feel that a shared account is still needed, complete the form below. **Note that systems with PCI data is not allowed shared accounts.** 

Please note that shared account request(s) will need to be reviewed and approved by IT Ops and the listed Tech Stack Owner. An [Exception Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance/compliance/issues/new?issuable_template=Exception%20Request) will need to be logged for each user you are requesting to be added. Note that with an Exception Requet the maximum exception length is 90 days. After the Exception Length, you will be required to submit another Exception Request for review and approval. **If the exception request is not logged, reviewed, and approved for an extension, note that the Shared Account will be disabled.** Please refer to our [Information Security Policy Exception](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#information-security-policy-exception-management-process) handbook page for more information.

For instructions and guidance for Managers and System Provisioners, refer to the [Instructions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/it-ops-team/access-requests/#instructions) section above.

##### Instructions and Guidance for IT 

1. Review the Shared Account Access Request and ensure that there is an [Exception Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance/compliance/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Exception%20Request) for each user that is being added to the shared account. 
1. Review the Exception Request and document in the Access Request issue the Exception Length.
1. Ensure that the Exception Request has been reviewed and approved by Security prior to adding your approval or setting up the shared account.
1. If the shared account will be managed in Okta - Set a review/reminder date in Okta to review shared account access dependent on exception timeline and close issue.
    1. When notification is received from Okta regarding timeline length nearing expiration, log a new Shared Account Access Request and assign to the Shared Account Owner to complete.
1. If the shared account will be managed in 1Password - Add a Due date dependent on exception timeline and leave issue open.
    1. When notificatino is received from `GitLab.com` regarding timeline length nearing expiration, close existing issue and log a new Shared Account Access Request and assign to the Shared Account Owner to complete.

## Department Access Request Boards
> * If you need additional labels or have suggestions for improving the process until we can fully automate, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/business-ops/itops/issue-tracker/issues).
> * ARs are auto-assigned and auto-labeled when possible by department. In some cases, there are multiple provisioners per tool. If a template cannot be auto-assigned, Business Operations will provide a board where the provisioners can review their department's issues by label (ie `dept::to do`. It is up to the department to manage the workflow on who works the issues to completion.
> * **Moving an issue from one column to another will remove the first label (per the column header) and add the second label. Please use caution when moving issues between columns.**
> * Departments can check their outstanding access request issues by viewing their board below.

## [Access Change Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/access-requests/issues/new?issuable_template=Access%20Change%20Request)

Access Change Requests are logged when a team member no longer requires access to a currently provisioned system or no longer requires the same level of access (downgraded access from admin to user etc). Refer to [`For People Ops Analysts: Processing Promotions & Compensation Changes`](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/promotions-transfers/#for-people-ops-analysts-processing-promotions--compensation-changes) section of the GitLab handbook for additional information. 

It is important to note that while Okta has provisioning/deprovisioning automation in place, this is not a complete/accurate reflection of access provisioning and deprovisioning. Okta has been configured to assign integrated/implemented applications based on a user's role/group. This makes applications accessible via Okta but users may still have the ability to access the systems directly. Refer to [Okta Application Stack](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/okta/okta-appstack/) for a list of applications set up in Okta.

What this means is:

1. A GitLab Team member gets transferred to a different role
1. The team member's profile in BambooHR is changed.
1. This profile change automatically triggers a change in his Okta profile accordingly.
1. This, in turn, results in the team member getting assigned to new applications based on his new department and role.
1. Simultaneously all old applications that are not relevant to his new role get revoked/unassigned.
1. Additionally, the Okta administrator gets an Email from Okta, that there has been a change to a User profile - (Email Subject line: 1 existing user updated). Okta automation already happens in the background, this email is informational only.

While this application automation will take place in Okta, "true" system provisioning and deprovisioning will still need to be manually completed within the impacted systems via an Access Change Request.
