When these MRs have been reviewed and are ready to be published, they will be assigned to the relevant engineering manager and have the `Ready` and `release post` labels applied. For example: [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/merge_requests/32608]().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+## Automation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+To help make this work a bit easier, a tool has been created to automate the manual process described below.

EMs will need to review these yaml files in order to determine if the feature is included in the release. To do so, look at the changes in the MR and find the `issue_url` referenced in the yaml file. That will point to the feature being described in the release post MR.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+### Step 2: Find the Related MRs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+From the relevant issue page, look at the related MRs for that issue. All related MRs assigned to the current milestone should be merged in order to be included in the release. If there are any MRs assigned to the current milestone that are not merged it should be determined that the feature is not complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+If all the related MRs assigned to the current milestone have been merged, the next step will be to verify that those MRs have been deployed and are running in production. This can be done by [querying chatops with the sha of the merge commit](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/quality/guidelines/tips-and-tricks/#determine-if-a-change-has-been-deployed-to-an-environment-using-revision-sha).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+If all of the chatops queries return a status indicating the sha is currently running in production, then it should be determined that the feature is complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+If one or more of those queries return a status indicating that they are not currently running in production, it should be determined that the feature is not complete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+### Step 3: Update Release Post MR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+When a featured is determined to be complete, the EM should merge the release post MR so the change can be included in the release post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+If a feature is not complete, the EM should update the milestone on the release post MR to be the milestone of the next release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+### Timeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+The release post MRs must be merged by the 17th of the month.

KubeCon may have been an amazing event, but it will have been covered by media everywhere. What matters to _our_ readers is what matters to GitLab. A better way to cover events that offers something new with a specific angle is to take one trend or session and do a deep dive on it, rather than trying to cover the conference as a whole.

We stay with users every step of the way to help them learn fast as a beginner and then become an expert over time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+### We&amp;#39;re building one product, together&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+We&amp;#39;re highly focused on ensuring that no matter how big our product gets, the entire experience stays cohesive, consistent, and interconnected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+### We&amp;#39;re humble facilitators of user experience design&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+Everyone is a designer; everyone can contribute. We are not egotistical, moody experts who alone hold the keys to user delight. We encourage Product Managers, Engineers, and the wider GitLab community to contribute to creating an exceptional user experience. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-Our principles are that GitLab should be **[productive](#productive), [minimal](#minimal), and [human](#human)**. We want to [*design*](https://library.gv.com/everyone-is-a-designer-get-over-it-501cc9a2f434) the most complete, uncomplicated, and adaptable DevOps tool on the market, enabling our users to spend more time adding business value in their own jobs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+### We look for small changes and big impacts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+Sometimes the simplest, most boring solution is what is needed to make users successful. We want our UI to stay out of the user’s way. We work iteratively to make modest but valuable changes that make users more productive, faster, and better at accomplishing their tasks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-#### Productive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-*Yielding favorable or useful results; constructive: a productive suggestion.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+### We&amp;#39;re informed by empathy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+We’re human, and we design for humans, so we strive for understanding, self-awareness, and connection.

[Everyone is a designer](https://library.gv.com/everyone-is-a-designer-get-over-it-501cc9a2f434).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-* Designers involve Product Managers, Engineers, and the wider community in problem discovery and definition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-* Designers, Product Managers, and Engineers are involved in UX research, backing solutions with data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+## Areas of responsibility &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* **Pajamas Design System:** To ensure that everyone can contribute to GitLab with confidence we provide everyone with the right resources and know-how. The [Pajamas](https://design.gitlab.com/) design system is the single source of truth for everything anyone needs to know about contributing to GitLab. The UX Department owns the visual and interaction design, as well as implementation of Pajamas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* **Navigation of GitLab UI:** Navigation is an extremely important part of the user experience.

[UX Scorecards](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/ux-scorecards/) is our framework for achieving this goal. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* **Technical Documentation:** Our users need reliable documentation, as it helps keep track of all aspects of a platform and it improves on the quality of a software product. We manage [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/) as well as related processes and tooling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* **First Look:** Inviting users into everything we do is very important to us in order to be able to collect feedback. [First Look](https://about.gitlab.com/community/gitlab-first-look/) is our user engagement and recruiting program, which enables us to connect with our users and get their thoughts on our product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* **UX Showcase:** Collaboration is one of our values. Our [UX Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0Kq89nFXtkVviaIfYQPptwJz) is a bi-monthly presentation of notable User Experience projects, where Product Designers from every stage group take turns sharing their accomplishments to collect feedback. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+## Heuristics for Success &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+The more we can check off each item in this list the more successful we will be:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-**Our solutions make users feel confident and efficient.**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; * Use the simplest, most boring solution for a problem.&lt;br&gt; * Understand the user&amp;#39;s goals and circumstances.&lt;br&gt; * Respect the importance of their work and avoid gimicky details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* Minimize distractions and clutter so users can focus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; * Provide sufficient feedback and direction to achieve user goals.&lt;br&gt; * Design holistic experiences and workflows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-#### Minimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-*Simplicity driving maximum effect.*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-**Design is about iteration, so we continuously iterate on our processes, too.**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-* We aggressively break down issues into the smallest effort that gets results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-* The design system will never be finished; it should always be evolving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* Continuously iterate on our processes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* Think big, but break it down into small steps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* Aggressively break down issues into the smallest effort that gets results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* Never stop improving our products, Pajamas, and documentation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; * Whenever possible, start in low-fidelity (wireframes, greyscale, etc.) to make sure we get it right before we go any further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-**Minimize distractions and clutter so users can focus.**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; * Understand the user journey and goals.&lt;br&gt; * Create hierarchy and a sense of direction to guide users through the flow.&lt;br&gt; * Maintain a strong information architecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-* Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to remove things that don&amp;#39;t contribute to the user flow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-#### Human&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-*Self-aware.

To that end, we support participation in relevant and valuable training and conferences, per GitLab&amp;#39;s policies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+Your manager will work with the UX Director to communicate and approve requests for professional development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+To attend training or a conference, follow these procedures:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.  Familiarize yourself with GitLab&amp;#39;s policies on [professional development expenses](/handbook/spending-company-money/#work-related-online-courses-and-professional-development-certifications) and [budget applications](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/processes/budget_approval.html).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.

Your manager can give guidance as to how likely your proposal is to be approved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.

Navigation is important, because it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+affects the usability and discoverability of our products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+We can think of our navigation as having two main types: **global navigation** (view projects, groups, account and user information) and **contextual navigation** &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+(access content specific to each page, primarily product features within a project or group). There is more detail on this in our [Pajamas documentation of navigation](https://design.gitlab.com/regions/navigation).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+## Who Makes Navigation Changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+Anyone can propose a navigation change by creating an issue, but a product team will have to take some ownership to get the change implemented. Typically this is the product team that owns the feature impacted by the navigation change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+Changes to the global navigation often fall under the [Growth](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#growth-section) or [Manage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#manage-stage) sections, so consider engaging them in your proposed change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+## How to Make Navigation Changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.  Create your issue, and add as much detail as you can. You can create the issue in the [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.  Label the issue with &amp;#39;UX&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;navigation&amp;#39;, and a stage group, if known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.  Engage your UX partners in product design and research. If the team doesn&amp;#39;t have a product designer, reach out to the UX Manager for the stage group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.  Follow the [product development workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product-development-flow/#validation-phase-2-problem-validation) validation process to ensure you are solving a well understood problem and that the proposed change is understandable and non-disruptive to users. Consider doing navigation-specific research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.  Consider whether you need to communicate the change somehow, or if you will have an interim period in the UI where your nav item will live in more than one place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+[ux-guide]: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ux_guide/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+[ux-label]: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/issues?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;label_name%5B%5D=UX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+[ux-ready-label]: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/issues?scope=all&amp;amp;state=opened&amp;amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;label_name%5B%5D=UX+ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+[gitlab-design-project-readme]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-design/blob/master/README.md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+[twitter-sheet]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GDAUNujD1-eRYxAj4FIYbCyy8ltCwwIWqVTd9-gf4wA/edit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+[everyone-designer]: https://library.gv.com/everyone-is-a-designer-get-over-it-501cc9a2f434&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+[pajamas]: https://design.gitlab.com&lt;/span&gt;</content>

When we reach five team members in a country, this is the indicator to proceed to PEO (Professional Employer Organisation).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; 1. The DRI for Country Conversion decisions is our Director of Tax. All requests for converting a country to PEO, will be sent by the Director of Tax to countryconversions@gitlab.com email alias and confirm the conversion priority (green, yellow or red according to urgency).&lt;br&gt; 1. The People Operations Specialist team will rotate which member of the team will be the country owner for the requested country. The assigned People Ops team member will send an email to all of our country vendors using the [Country Conversions Quote Request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/-/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/cc_emailtemplate_quote.md) template to request a quote from all current PEO vendors to compare benefits, cost, and ability to scale. The countryconversions@gitlab.com email alias should also be copied on this email for full transparency and visibility. &lt;br&gt; 1. As the People Operations Specialst receives requested information from vendors, they should proceed with the following steps:&lt;br&gt; * Save all quotes in the appropriate vendor folder within the [Country Vendor Information](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/14nhToiahmt5ANKoHGTbJztjaQ3jEVP6r) folder in Google Drive&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-* Add all data and team member information to the Contractor Conversions sheet found in the People Group Drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+* Add all data and team member information for the Contractor Conversions sheet found in the People Group Drive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; * Create an issue in the [People-Group general issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General) by using the [Country Conversions template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/General/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/countryconversions.md)&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#f9d7dc&quot;&gt;-* Once the country issue above is created, the People Operations Specialist should send an email to all team members located in the country being considered for conversion so they are able to track updates real-time and provide feedback. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ddfbe6&quot;&gt;+1.

Once all country vendor quotes and benefits information are obtained, the People Operations Specialist will make a `non-official country vendor recommendation` based on: employee experience, social norm in the location, cost impact to the employee, overall SLA between GitLab and the PEO vendor, cost impact to GitLab, PEO vendor ability to scale and delivery quickly, alignment with our [values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/), and meeting tech needs/digital way of working. This recommendation should be shared with the larger People Operations International Expansion for feedback in the #country_conversions Slack channel. &lt;br&gt; 1. Once the initial recommendation is determined, the People Operations Specialist will ping the Manager of Compensation &amp;amp; Benefits in the corresponding country issue, sharing benefits information from all vendors. &lt;br&gt; 1. The Compensation &amp;amp; Benefits Group will focus on benefits evaluation for the `non-official country vendor recommendation` first and aim to align the benefits package with GitLab&amp;#39;s needs. </content>
