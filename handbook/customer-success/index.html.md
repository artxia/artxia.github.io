## Mission Statement
To deliver value to all customers by engaging in a consistent, repeatable, scalable way across defined segments so that customers see the value in their investment with GitLab, and we retain and drive growth in our within our enterprise customers.

* The mission of the Customer Success Department is to provide these customers with experience in order to:
    * Accelerate initial customer value
    * Maximize long-term, sustainable customer value
    * Improve overall customer satisfaction & referenceability
    * Maximize the total value of the customer to GitLab


## Vision Page
The ["Customer Success Vision Page"](/handbook/customer-success/vision) provides the long-term view of company wide success to which the customer success will be building in partnership with the value centers of the GitLab organization (i.e., Marketing, Sales, Product/Engineering, Support, Finance and IT).

## Department Initiatives
Our large and strategic customers are in need of an ongoing partnership that combines expert guidance with flexibility and adaptability to support their adoption and continuous improvement initiatives.  

These customers expect that partner to provide a streamlined, consistent and fully coordinated experience that encompasses the full span of their needs as well as the fully lifecycle of the relationship.
Need to focus on 4 main areas in order to grow in our existing accounts as well as land large and strategic:

1. Awareness
2. Adoption
3. Usage
4. Performance

### Initiative: Awareness
Opportunity to improve the overall awareness of GitLab in order to promote and evangelize our brand and solution in a meaningful way to provide big business impact to our customers so that they believe in our vision and strategy.

### Initiative: Adoption
Ensuring paying customers are successful in their onboarding in order to gain adoption and get the most out of our platform and remain happy, paying GitLab team-members and brand advocates.

### Initiative: Usage
Collecting and making use of customer data and insights is key to customer success.  Itâ€™s important to do more with data and when necessary share back with customers, which in turn helps and encourages our customers to improve and drive adoption.

### Initiative: Performance
Utilizing built-in monitoring instrumentation and [a scalable HA architecture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/high_availability/README.html#reference-architecture), The Customer Success team helps ensure implementations of GitLab are operating at peak performance as organization scale and adopt more features.

## Transition and Handoff Workflow

In an effort to capture the wider scope of customer interactions with GitLab, the flow outlined below will soon addresses the business processes involved through the entire service lifecycle and customer journey.  There is an active initiative to unify stages, phases, titles, names, etc led by Marketing and Sales.

## Responsibility Matrix and Transitions

The table below depicts the relationships between activities, responsible roles, relationship and opportunity stages in the customer lifecycle.  A more detailed in the [responsibility assignment matrix (RACI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) format will be an critical tool for every GitLab customer.

|  **Sequence** | Activity                                    | Who's Responsible | Business Relationship Stage | Opportunity Stage | Output  |
|  ------: | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ | :------ |
|  **1** | Create relationship lifecycle meta-record (e.g., SFDC) | Account Executive | Lead or Contact | Discovery | A data record containing information related to the prospect and having data fields attributes that will support the long term ability to "current state" of a customer at any given point in the lifecycle.  This cell links to an example customer "meta-record" |

## Customer Success Data Management

Customer names, customer information security and NDA compliance are critical concerns for Customer Success, since we communicate with customers every day. All issues managing work as it relates to prospects and customers must be private and confidential. Work should be managed only in approved GitLab projects and never within private repositories. GitLab employee-only accessible projects for work management include:

* [us-public-sector](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/us-public-sector) parent project for all public sector work
* [account-management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/) parent project for account-specific work and collaboration with the rest of sales
* [customer-success](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success) parent project for Customer Success employee, shared or triage work

### Using Salesforce within Customer Success

Visit [this page](/handbook/customer-success/using-salesforce-within-customer-success/) for more info on using Salesforce within Customer Success

### Customer Success Metrics

We currently have a [Customer Success Metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/cs-metrics) Project within GitLab. This project is used to requesting new reports, dashboards and suggesting new metrics that we may need for the department.

This will sometimes be cross-referenced with a data & analytics project.

### Optimized Account Growth Program

In order to evangelize and grow the use of GitLab in existing accounts, the [Optimized Account Growth Program](/handbook/customer-success/optimized-account-growth-program) has been developed to facilitate collaborative sessions and workshops within customer environments. The program is intended to improve the partnership between GitLab and the customer, solving complex business problems while reducing cycle times and improving workflow, ultimately resulting in the growth in adoption and usage of GitLab in customer environments.

### Dogfooding

Outside of Engineering the Customer Success team has the largest concentration of tooling development capability. The team has unique needs that can't always be solved by GitLab's single DevOps platform. However, it is important to [dogfood](/handbook/values/#dogfooding) and avoid [dogfooding anti-patterns](/handbook/engineering/#dogfooding-antipatterns).  As a result the [Product organization heavily weights internal customers](/handbook/values/#dogfooding) when considering prioritization. If you are considering building tooling in support of Customer Success priorities outside of GitLab, please follow the [dogfooding process](/handbook/values/#dogfooding).

### Customer Success AWS Test Account

In an effort to keep AWS spend down initiatives are being taken automatically clean up our AWS account. This account is primarily used as a proof of concept for IaC and creating demo's for GitLab customers. An automated cleanup script is currently being test that will tag, shutdown and delete old resources as they are no longer needed. The automation will...

* Turn off and Tag Un-named resources. When resources are created a "Name" tag should be created with a value that's meaningful and indicates who deployed the resource. Example: {initials}-GitLabRunner
* New Resources will be automatically tagged with a Discovered and Expiration tag.
* The Expiration tag is 14 days after the discovery. The script will only a tag an instance once. If you need additional time, please change the date to a reasonable date for cleanup (Add a month or two for prospective customers).
* If a resource needs to be permanent please set termination protection on the instance. This should also include tagging the instance with an explanation on why it's permanent and what its for.
* On expiration the resource will be shut off and left for 7 days.
* In 7 days if the instance is still off a snapshot will be taken and it will be terminated.
* If the instance is still on but the expiration has not been changed it will be terminated.

### Customer Success & Market Segmentation
For definitions of the account size, refer to [market segmentation](/handbook/business-ops/resources/#segmentation).

- Large: Strategic Account Leader closes deal and stays on account for growth and renewal. Solutions Architect is assigned pre-sales and transitions the account to a Technical Account Manager after the sale to guide customer adoption and growth.
- Mid-Market: Account Executive closes deal with Solutions Architect pre-sales assistance. Customer then transfers to Technical Account Manager to guide customer adoption and growth.
- SMB: Web Portal with Sales Admin and SMB Technical Account Manager oversight.
