## Welcome to the Commercial Sales Handbook

### About 

The Commercial Sales department is part of the overall [GitLab Sales](/handbook/sales) functional group. We focus on [SMB and Mid-Market](/handbook/business-ops/resources/#segmentation) customers to deliver maximum value throughout the entire journey with GitLab.

### Center of Excellence

The Center of Excellence (COE) in the Commercial Sales context refers to the team's research and development of a particular focus area to drive new initiatives and improvements across the organization.  

Why call it Center of Excellence? 
- We have challenges we are uniquely positioned to focus on
- We aren’t the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) but it is a challenge to get this prioritized
- This is our current platform for collaboration

How?
1. Choose one of the active Topics currently available below. Refer to the team list to see what is unassigned.  Note, to take a topic you do not have to be a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the area or DRI as they may belong to a different functional group. 
2. Pick an achievable set of commitments and nail it. These should be forecastable and not something too aspirational for the timeframe
3. Decide for yourself if you want that same topic for 3 or 6 months
4. Start with the problem related to your subject that you think needs to be solved

#### Commercial COE Topics
Here are the current active topics for individual team members on COE alignment. This center in its first iteration started with the team's QBR in 2019.

### Events

When traveling please consider ROI of both any costs plus your time:
If you are going to an event you think first:

*  What is the total you will spend for travel?
*  What is the total you will spend on food and lodging for me?
*  What is the amount you will likely spend on customer meals (meals x customers x # of times)?
*  How many total business hours will you be away from salesforce?
*  8 hours: then you need to get 5x return on $, and the fact that any event pipeline closes at about 30%
*  How many total personal life hours will you be away from your personal life?

Given the rough calculation above, you've to be committed driving/booking enough iACV at the event prior to you going to the event
Note: this doesn’t mean you can’t get travel approval without booking meetings. It means once you get travel approval it is on you to go get people to the event/meetings to create pipeline.

#### Trip Notes

The ultimate purpose of attending any GitLab field event is to gain insight and add value. Sid Sijbrandij, our CEO, talks about the importance of conferences and events [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ0CL3J08lI). He believes the main goal of GitLab team participation should always be to connect with our customers and prospects and not to solely attend presentations. Trip notes are our internal process for tracking and capturing this data. 

#### Why and When?

Trip notes are required  for the entire Commercial Sales Team anytime a team member travels for the company while working at GitLab. We believe it would be fun and valuable if you also shared trip notes when you traveled for personal reasons; however, that is up to your discretion.

#### How to properly document your trip notes?

Please follow the best practice process and use the [trip note template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B6EBhrzMhHynDUV6_K2qzuQqZ1jI_DfjCsUviJI_r_k/edit) as a format to prepare for your future trip. 

#### Trip Notes Best Practice

1. Commercial attendee will write up their notes in a google doc. 
2. Please save your notes as GitLab internal read only for Commercial Team review in the [Commercial Sales Drive Trip Notes Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e71aL5OP_QlaAHTmMNwAAqIUfc2aD6Dt).
3. Once saved, please slack and share a link to your notes in the commercial_global_all channel to alert the team of your recent trip.
4. Finally, please share your [Post Trip feedback](/handbook/marketing/events/#post-event) for the entire company and the Field Marketing team directly in the specific Event Issue on the ‘Post Event Recap & Feedback’ spreadsheet.

### Give Back Project

#### What is the Give Back Project?

* The Give Back Project is a self-selected opportunity to help the Commercial Sales team achieve better results. It is a finite project that, upon completion, is to be adopted by no less than 70% of the Commercial Sales team and used at least once a month. 

* The Give Back Project is assigned to all new Commercial Sales team members and is required to be completed as part of their on-boarding process. 

#### Why is there a Give Back Project?

* The goal of the Give Back Project is to allow new team members to be able to instantly contribute to the Commercial Sales team 
* Fosters GitLab’s values of collaboration and results
* The Give Back Project gives team members the opportunity to be exposed to problems on the team today and will allow the team to look back and see how we addressed shortcomings in the past

#### How does the Give Back Project differ from the Center of Excellence?

* The COE is assigned while the Give Back is self-selected
* During team QBRs in February 2019, it was determined that there were certain aspects that made selling at GitLab difficult. Those aspects were divided into categories and those categories were assigned to different team members to become experts at, forming the Center of Excellence 
* The COE has already been determined by the team as areas where the team needs improvements while the value of a team member’s Give Back Project needs to be realized
* A Give Back Project can be working on a portion of the COE

#### How to properly document a Give Back Project

* Give Back Projects are described and worked by team members in the [Commercial Sales issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/commercial-sales/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Give+Back+Project)
* If it is something that needs to be repeated (like a customer AMA) an associated handbook entry is created with a description on how a new person could achieve this
* Although the Give Back Project is designed to be finite, there is always room for iteration at GitLab. Be sure to include any necessary instructions on how a different team member would be able to add to your project if necessary

#### Give Back Projects

**Customer AMAs:** Meetings for GitLab team members with current customers that provide an opportunity to ask them about anything in regards to their experience with GitLab

**Customer Meetings:** Sharing the best practices for conducting any kind of external meeting at GitLab

**Trip Notes:** allows team members who attend field events to track and capture data in order for the rest of the team to gain insight

### Salesforce Hygiene & Activity

####  Opportunity Management in Salesforce
- Prior to working a new opportunity always double-check the Account segmentation is "SMB" and the employee count for the company is less than 100, by viewing datafox information
- Every SMB CA has an inidividual view for opportunity management: Access this view under the Opportunities tab in saleforce and use the drop down to find your view "SMB_name_ Active Opptys".
- Once in the view follow the below steps for opportunity management; 

1. Sort by stage, placing highest priority stage at the top
2. Prioritize the opportunities you are going to work on first by stage, amount, and close date
3. Ensure "Next Steps" and "Next Step Date" are current with actionable and informative information that helps guide you on how to move the opportunity through the pipeline
4. If a potential future opportunity that require action greater than 30 days out create an event with detailed notes on your agenda or action items
5. Once stages Discovery - Awaiting Signature are updated, begin working on Pending Acceptance. Prioritize with the same criteria as above, rinse and repeat

2. If not a duplicate, place the main contact in the opportunity on the outreach sequence "SMB_Web Direct Outreach" - by: Madeline Hennessy
3. Dependent on the opportunity and company if personal outreach is preferred, you must log your activity and have a next step date to follow up on your activity
