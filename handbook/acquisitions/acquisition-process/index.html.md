This is a detailed view of our acquisition process. For more information about
our acquisitions approach visit our [acquisitions handbook](/handbook/acquisitions).

### Acquisitions Deal Funnel

## Acquisition process
The process is comprised of four key stages:
1. Exploratory
1. Early diligence
1. Due Diligence
1. Integration

### Sourcing & Initial Screening
1. Sourcing: We closely collaborate with GitLab's product leadership to identify key areas for potential M&A. We source acquisition opportunities from:
    1. Ecosystem screen with the help of third party databases such as Crunchbase
    2. Inbound introductions from GitLabbers and industry contacts
    3. Proactive outreach to companies aligned with our vision and strategic priorities
1. We prioritize companies that fit with our product and acquisition priorities and reach out to their leadership to set up an intro call. 
1. Intro call: The purpose of this 30-min call is to learn more about the potential target company and assess if further acquisition discussions make sense. The agenda for the call is as follows:
    1. Company overview including team, products, financials, and funding
    1. Discuss which features could accelerate GitLab's roadmap
    1. Review the GitLab acquisition process including deal terms, as appropriate ([acquisitions handbook](/handbook/acquisitions))
    1. Details from this call should be collected following the [Initial Acquisition Review Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RekjfQj89pIV7DZzeNZ00HYOwqlqlDFm7Gy4yZET9rc/edit?usp=sharing)(a GitLab internal document).
    1. TARGET TEAM: Ahead of this call please review our [roadmap](/direction/) and outline which of your current and future product features can be implemented into GitLab's product categories. Outline a simple integration timeline for those features, considering an MVC release on the first month after joining GitLab and monthly releases following with quick iterations.
1. Create a new, private Slack channel (format: `#acq-company_name`) and add the internal GitLab document to the top. Add VP Product Strategy and the relevant product and engineering leaders to help with the initial assessment of the opportunity. 
1. If product leaders want to proceed and see a potential strategic fit, set up initial product and tech call to learn about the product (demo, roadmap), technology and team. Discuss which features could be built into GitLab and into which GitLab product stage. Confirm strategy fit to GitLab's [product roadmap](/direction/).
1. Internal review: preliminary assessment of product and technology fit of the potential opportunity as well as integration options into GitLab. If the product lead is supportive of moving forward towards developing a more in depth business case, determine if the proposed acquisition is aligned with current product priorities and planned headcount allocations. Otherwise, set up a discussion with VP of Product before proceeding with further diligence.

### Early Diligence
1. Select [code name](/handbook/acquisition-process/#acquisitions_are_confidential) to use instead of target company name. Update Slack channel: `#acq-code_name`.
1. Sign a mutual NDA as linked on our [legal handbook page](/handbook/legal/).
1. [Form the acquisition team](/handbook/acquisition-process/#forming_an_acquisition_team).
1. Confirm internal acquisition champion - every acquisition needs a champion; someone who is advocating for the acquisition, helping drive the acquisition rationale, and seeing its successful integration. For most acquisitions that fit our [approach](/handbook/acquisitions), the champion will come from GitLab's Product team, at the Director level. For other acquisitions, champions may come from engineering or possibly other functions.
1. Preliminary financial & legal diligence - list of preliminary documents to share with GitLab:
   1. Financials
   1. Tax returns
   1. Employee roster with: employee name, title, role, tenure, years of experience, location, salary, LinkedIn profile, programming languages proficiency
   1. Employee resumes 
   1. Employee agreements and PIAA
   1. Customer list with name, monthly revenue, contract termination date and any other fields if relevant.
   1. Vendor list with monthly spend
   1. Asset list
   1. Any assets that are needed for the business and will be part of the acquisition
   1. Assets excluded from the acquisition
1. Early technical diligence:
   1. In case the target company has open source components, the respective Dir. Engineering (dependent on GitLab stage) will start an early code review to determine: code quality, development practices, contributions and more. That should be turned around within 2-3 business days.
   1. Hands-on product and code screen-share session (2 hours): the technical lead, as assigned by the respective Dir. Engineering, together with the respective Dir. Product will lead a screen-share session aimed at a hands-on validation of the product functionalities and an overview of the code.
   1. Founder technical interviews - founders will go through two rounds of interviews to assess technical and cultural alignment.
1. Resume review - Review of all employee resumes
1. Compensation review to identify any gaps and possible flags led by the HR Business Partner
1. Optional interviews for key technical employees - to increase the success rate of the deal, we recommend conducting interviews for key technical employees before signing the term sheet. This will greatly reduce the likelihood of personnel gaps becoming a blocker during the Due Diligence stage. The interviews will include a technical interview and a manager interview as detailed in the Due Diligence stage below.
   1. The key technical employees are those identified as critical to the success of the acquisition, the proposed integration plan and the future of the team at GitLab post integration.
1. Prepare business case
   1. Product integration strategy: the internal acquisition champion will formalize the integration strategy with a focus on feature sets/functionalities:
      1. What we keep as-is
      1. What we reimplement in GitLab
      1. What we discard/EOL
      1. Critical for user migration
      1. Target [product tiers](/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/tiers/) in GitLab
      1. Barriers for implementation
      1. Deal milestones:
         1. Typically we aim to set 3-4 milestones, to provide a concise set of goals which should cover the bulk of our product interest in the target company
         1. Integrated within 6 months:
            1. 6 months is an optimal timeframe which isn't too far sighted where possible changes in priorities could consequently lead to us negating our interest in said milestones. This could further lead to complexed legal scenarios where payments are subject to milestone completion but if those were changed then  circumstances are different.
            1. Will help establish focus on both acquired target and our product team
            1. Be able to complete payouts to the target's entity and shut it down sooner
         1. First milestone shipped within 30 days of joining GitLab:
            1. Critical to adopting our culture and successful future integration of the target's engineering team in GitLab.
            1. Allows us to show early fruits of the acquisitions soon, aligned with our value of iteration.
   1. To determine the deal ROI, the acquisition team will perform the analysis using the [cost-revenue acquisition calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ke36-mtEi8MhfMKXpYGMRP6H3HH6MimxXt86Zv_QkzM/edit#gid=0) (_internal_ GitLab document). Make a copy of the master cost-revenue acquisition calculator file and save it in the relevant project folder in Google Drive before making changes to the file.
   1. Present business case for internal review of the acquisition proposal.
   1. Term sheet and Exclusivity Agreement: Using the [Term sheet template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bSnGDPS94BGd8C9MfUvJA34X-AcpVp7wDekcBIL_Adw/edit)(_internal_ GitLab document) and the [Exclusivity Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QhEVaLYjytxtxCKDc6eoE4Ix9lelb3dOlKgLEK8lKOg/edit?usp=sharing), assuming all terms have been reviewed, the acquisition lead will prepare both agreements for digital signing.

### Confirmatory Due Diligence
1. To kick-off the Confirmatory Due Diligence stage, email the target company with the following clarifications and information:
   1. All employees and their profiles will be reviewed by the GitLab team
   1. The employees who will be invited for an interview process will go through GitLab's standard interview process
   1. Key employees who were interviewed during the Early Diligence stage may go through further interview rounds as determined by the GitLab team to qualify for a role at GitLab
   1. All employees must identify an open vacancy at GitLab which they think best matches their professional profile. This will be shared in a spreadsheet gathered by the target's CEO.
1. [Technical diligence](acquisition-process-technical-diligence/)
1. Financial & legal due diligence
1. The progress of the diligence will be synced on a regular stand-up call for the acquisition team
1. Final internal review call with the acquisition team to recap the acquisition as a whole and present a final recommendation

### Integration

## Acquisitions are confidential
At GitLab, we treat all acquisition discussions as confidential and share any information internally on a need-to-know basis. If you're part of an acquisition Slack channel, Google Doc, or other internal GitLab discussion and would like to invite another GitLab team member to one of those, please confirm with the acquisition lead before doing so.

To ensure confidentiality during the acquisition process, we assign code names to each potential transaction once we enter the Early Diligence stage. Everyone involved in the project should use the code name in place of the actual company name in all communication about the deal until it is publicly announced.
