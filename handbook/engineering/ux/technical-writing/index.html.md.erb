## About Us

The primary goal of the Technical Writing team is to continuously develop GitLab's
product documentation content to meet the evolving needs of all users and administrators.

Documentation is intended to educate readers about features and best practices,
and to enable them to efficiently configure, use, and troubleshoot GitLab. To this end, the
team also manages the [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com) site and related process and tooling.

Our team comprises:

- A [technical writing manager](/job-families/engineering/technical-writing-manager/).
- A group of [technical writers](/job-families/engineering/technical-writer/).

Technical writers partner with anyone in the GitLab community who is concerned with
documentation, especially developers, who are typically the first to update docs for the
GitLab features that they code.

The technical writing team Slack channel is [#docs-team](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CCB575BGT)
and technical writers are also active in the larger [#docs](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/C16HYA2P5) channel (both private to GitLab Inc.).

## Projects

Technical writers:

- Act as maintainers of documentation for many [engineering projects](../../engineering/projects/).
- Frequently act as authors or reviewers of the documentation in collaboration with others in the GitLab community.
- Are [assigned](#assignments) to specific DevOps stage groups.

For more information on documentation at GitLab, see:

- The [Documentation](../../documentation/) section of the Handbook.
- [GitLab Documentation guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/) in the contributor documentation.

## Responsibilities

The team is broadly responsible for the following at GitLab.

### Content

- [Documentation content](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Documentation&label_name[]=epic-level-1&search=Content), including:
  - [Developing new content](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/774) to meet the needs of the community.
  - [Reviewing and collaborating on documentation plans](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/776), reviewing doc merge requests or recently merged docs, and ensuring that content meets style and language standards.
  - [Reorganizing, revamping, and authoring improved content](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/775) to ensure completeness and a smooth user experience.
- UI content
  - Collaborating with Product Designers on and review of various forms of UI text, such as microcopy, links from the UI to documentation, error messages, UI element labels, etc.

### Publishing

[Documentation Site](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Documentation) (docs.gitlab.com) including
maintaining and enhancing the documentation site’s:

- Architecture
- Design
- Automation
- Versioning
- Search
- SEO
- Feedback methods
- Analytics

### Processes

[Documentation Process](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/779), including:

- Ensuring that processes are in place and being followed to keep the GitLab docs up to date.
- Following and optimizing documentation workflows with Product and Engineering, Documentation Team workflows, and the division of work.
- Triaging doc-related issues.
- Refining the Documentation Style Guide and continuously improving content about GitLab documentation and its contribution process.
- Making it easier for anyone to contribute to the documentation while efficiently handling community contributions to docs.

### Collaboration

[Collaboration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/779), including:

- Working on documentation efforts with Product, Support, Marketing, Engineering, Community Marketing, other GitLab teams, and the wider GitLab community.
- Ensuring that relevant documentation is easily accessible from within the product.
- Acting as reviewers of the monthly [release post](../../handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/).

This work is sorted into the [top-level Documentation epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?label_name%5B%5D=Documentation&label_name%5B%5D=epic-level-1&scope=all&sort=created_asc&state=opened&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
linked above.

#### Assignments

Technical writers (aka "TWs" or "docs team") are assigned to and collaborate
with other teams and groups as described in the [DevOps stages](/handbook/product/categories/)
and other subjects according to the tables below.

##### Designated technical writers

The designated technical writer is the go-to person for their assigned
stage groups. They collaborate with other team members to plan new
documentation, edit existing documentation, review any proposed changes
to documentation, suggest changes to the microcopy exposed to the end-user,
and generally partner with subject-matter experts in all situations where
documentation is required.

The backup writer is assigned to cover merge request reviews and
urgent matters for the designated tech writer when they are out
(vacations, sickness, and any other temporary leave). They can
also naturally pair to work together on complex issues when needed.

Note that there are some [planned changes to these assignments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrCG7N9d9XxKAR46xmu8axLaubZw9ESmzVkLyGotteQ/).

_(1)_ Note: [Development guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/) refer to the docs under [`gitlab/doc/development/*`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/tree/master/doc/development).
If the changes to this section introduced in an MR are specifically related to a stage group,
the technical writer assigned to that group should perform the review and CC `@marcia`
for her information.

##### Onboarding technical writers

While the technical writer is onboarding, they will be assigned to
shadow groups and then start contributing as trainees, as described
below. Veteran technical writers will coach them through the process.

To consult the current assignments, see the [onboarding technical writers spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KULdrZZpUPFMp-vYhw3fErlit9oD99Yh6L60aMsiyc/edit#gid=0).

**Group shadowing**

For the first release cycle that begins after the new member start
date, they will shadow (read) their buddy's work in their most active
Stage Group, plus one other stage group/writer decided with the
tech writing manager and the team. Veteran technical writers will
proactively share relevant issues, merge requests, and communications
with their shadows by using a `#tw-onboarding-<groupname>`
Slack channel, creating it if it doesn't already exist, and answering questions.

**Group trainees**

For the second release cycle that begins after the new member's start
date, unless the tech writing manager extends the shadowing phase,
they will act as a trainee on one or more groups as assigned by the manager.
The intent is to take on the group as its technical writer as of the
next release. The veteran technical writer who is assigned to that Group
will assign substantial parts of the work to the new member for this group,
which accounts to roughly half of the groups's reviews of MRs with docs, UI text,
and release post content; a small but substantial documentation
authoring project; a few minor doc improvement projects/fixes.

**Group coaching**

For the third release cycle, the onboarding tech writer assumes the
full role of technical writer for their assigned group, except that
they will not yet have merge rights. The former TW assigned to the group is now the coach,
who will review all their work (including reviews they perform of other authors)
before merging it or approving it for another maintainer to merge.
They may share the burden of these reviews with other technical writers.

#### Reviews

Technical writers are assigned for merge request reviews
(of both team members and community contributors) according
to the [stage groups they are assigned](#assignments).

## Documentation process

See:

- [Technical Writing workflow](workflow/) in the handbook.
- [Documentation workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html) in the contributor documentation.

## FY20 Vision

- [New Content Development](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/774) - Leading the planning and authoring of new content to better meet user needs. This will be a significantly increased proportion of the team’s work, and will make use of improved methods and standards.
  - Authoring docs that better address use cases with A-to-Z process flows, going beyond existing feature references and procedures that can be difficult to adapt to real-world use cases. Supported by [updated standards for content types and structure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/74).
  - [Getting Started](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/782) - a.k.a. unboxing or onboarding docs for various audiences and scenarios.
- [Content Improvement](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/775):
  - Revamping existing content pages/sections, so that they meet our latest standards, including contextual information on every page (what, why, who).
  - Improve use of documentation feedback/sensing mechanisms. Improved sourcing and channeling/triage; making use of existing comments and issues, while bringing in new sources including search data, surveys, user testing, etc.
  - [Improve rate of contributions to docs as SSOT](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/issues/51) and using ‘docs-first’ methods by tracking contributions and demonstrating best practices.
- Docs UX:
  - Next iteration of [docs versioning](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/issues/248).
  - [Removing documentation from /help](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/693), linking instead from UI to versioned links on docs.gitlab.com.
