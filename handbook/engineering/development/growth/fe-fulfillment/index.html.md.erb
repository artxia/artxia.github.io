## Mission

The Fulfillment Frontend Team is responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the UI/UX experience for users who purchase or trial GitLab products and services. Our objective is to provide a seamless license purchase and management experience with Gitlab.com.

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Front End Fulfillment Group:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Frontend Engineering Manager, Fulfillment') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Fulfillment/, direct_manager_role: 'Frontend Engineering Manager, Fulfillment') %>

## How we work

The team meets once per week (see team calendar). This is the opportunity for the Fulfillment Frontend team to discuss topics related to our work. The objective of the meeting is to synchronously clarify any topics outstanding from the previous week or may affect our work in the upcoming week. This meeting also serves to fill-in context that maybe missing from purely written communication. Communicating highlights from this meeting to the greater team helps with any cross-team missing information.

All team members should feel free to contribute topics to the agenda.

Topics should include:

* Wins from the past week
* Problems which have been impeding or blocking fluid progress
* Planning for upcoming week and weighting backlog issues

The Engineering Manager will assign issues to be weighted ahead of the weekly meeting. At the end of the meeting we will discuss the issues any potential pitfalls and collectively assign a weight. We will use a weight system where 5 is roughly 2 developer weeks of work. Issues with weight greater than 5 should be broken down into smaller issues.

When possible, larger issues should be broken into multiple MRs. Technical discussion should happen in the MR, while questions for the Product and Design teams should be addressed in the associated issue.

We follow the standard MR and [Code Review](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/) process with a few exceptions. Since the Fulfillment Frontend Team is relatively new, we don't have a maintainer for the [Customer portal](/handbook/engineering/projects/#customers-app) or the [License app](/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab-license) on the team. For the reason, and to increase diversity of reviewers, Frontend maintainers of the [GitLab CE](/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab-ce) and [GitLab EE](/handbook/engineering/projects/#gitlab-ee) projects should merge Frontend MRs for the Customer portal and Licence app projects.

For the [Customer portal](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com) MRs should be branched from and merged into the staging branch.

New features are released behind feature flags using GitLab's [Unleash](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash). The feature is first enabled on Staging by the engineer responsible for the merge request. The Product Manager and Designer are then assigned to the merge request for review. The label `workflow::verification` should also be added the issue. After receiving approval from reviewers the engineer will set the feature live in production.
