## Vision

For an understanding of what this team is going to be working on take a look at [the product
vision](/direction/verify/).

## Mission

The Verify Stage is made up of the following groups focused on all the functionality with respect to
Continuous Integration and Verification.

This team maps to [Verify](/handbook/product/categories/#verify-stage) devops stage.

## Groups

[Verify:Continuous Integration](/handbook/engineering/development/ci-cd/verify/continuous-integration/)  
[Verify:Runner](/handbook/engineering/development/ci-cd/verify/runner/)  
[Verify:Testing](/handbook/engineering/development/ci-cd/verify/testing/)  

## Technologies

Like most GitLab backened teams we spend a lot of time working in Rails on the main [GitLab CE app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce), but we also do a lot of work in Go which is the language that [GitLab Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner) is written in. Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes is also useful on our team.
