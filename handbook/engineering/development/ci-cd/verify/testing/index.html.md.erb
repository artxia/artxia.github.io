## Vision

For an understanding of what this team is going to be working on take a look at [the product
vision](/direction/verify/).

## Mission

The Verify:Testing Group is focused on all the functionality with respect to
Continuous Integration.

This team maps to [Verify](/handbook/product/categories/#verify-stage) devops stage.

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Verify:Testing group:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Testing') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Verify/, direct_manager_role: 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Testing', other_manager_roles: ['Frontend Engineering Manager, Verify', 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Continuous Integration', 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Runner']) %>

## Technologies

Like most GitLab backened teams we spend a lot of time working in Rails on the main [GitLab CE app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce), but we also do a lot of work in Go which is the language that [GitLab Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner) is written in. Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes is also useful on our team.
