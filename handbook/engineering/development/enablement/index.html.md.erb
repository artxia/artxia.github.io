## Vision

Offer enterprise-grade operational experience of GitLab products from streamlined deployment and maintenance, disaster recovery, secure search and discoverability, to high availability, scalability, and performance, as well as enabling and growing a healthy ecosystem community.


## Mission

Enablement focuses on improving our capabilities and metrics in the following areas:

 * [Database](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/database/)
 * [Distribution](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/distribution/)
 * [Ecosystem](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/ecosystem/)
 * [Geo (Disaster Recovery)](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/geo/)
 * [Memory](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/memory/)
 * [Search](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/search/)

## Section Members

The following people are permanent members of the Enablement Section:

<%
departments = ['Database', 'Distribution', 'Ecosystem', 'Geo' , 'Memory', 'Search']
interim_manager_departments = ['Fulfillment']
department_regexp = /(#{Regexp.union(departments)})/
%>

<%=  direct_team(role_regexp: department_regexp, manager_role: 'Director of Engineering, Enablement') %>

## All Team Members

The following people are permanent members of teams that belong to the Enablement Section:

<% departments.each do |dep| %>
### <%= dep %>
  <% manager_role = interim_manager_departments.include?(dep) ? "Engineering Manager, #{dep} (Interim)" : "Engineering Manager, #{dep}" %>
  <%= direct_team(manager_role: manager_role) %>
<% end %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Enablement/, direct_manager_role: 'Director of Engineering, Enablement') %>

## How We Work

* [Apply budget for professional development](./processes/budget_approval.html)
* Integrated Team (Pilot Program)

  The Enablement section is experimenting `Integrated Team` model where both Frontend and Backend Engineers report to a single Engineering Manager and work in an integral team, which is different from many other sections. The frontend work of Enablement teams are relatively light compared to other sections, as a result the ratio of BE:FE is 12:1 by the end of FY2020, and the projected ratio of FY2021 is even higher. After taking many factors into consideration (see [discussions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues/5775)), Enablement section will continue experimenting the Integrated Team model for operational efficiency.
