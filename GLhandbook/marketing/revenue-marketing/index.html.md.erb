## What is Revenue Marketing Handbook

The Revenue Marketing department includes the Sales Development, Field Marketing and Digital Marketing Programs (including Online Marketing & Marketing Program Management). The units in this functional group employ a variety of marketing and sales crafts in service of our current and future customers with the belief that providing our audiences value will in turn grow GitLab's business.

- **Opportunities per XDR per month created**: The net number of unique opportunities that are created and have a "sales development representative" assigned/attached to the opportunity segmented by xDR and by month.

- **Pipe-to-spend per marketing activity**: Pipeline (IACV on Opportunities) divided by the total marketing program spend, broken down by marketing activity. 
- **Marketing Efficiency Ratio**: Marketing efficiency for a given month is calculated as the ratio of IACV from closed won opportunities for the current month and the 2 preceding months vs the Marketing Operating Expenses (IACV / Marketing Operating Expenses) for the same time period. GitLab's target is greater than 2.
