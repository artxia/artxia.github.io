## Overview

This page focuses on the different types of Virtual Events run by the Marketing Programs team. 

## Who to work with

Virtual events that fall within the scope of an integrated campaign will be supported by the MPM DRI for that integrated campaign. Virtual events that fall outside the scope of an integrated campaign will be supported by @aoetama.

For a list of active integrated campaigns and MPM DRIs for each campaign, please reference the [Integrated Campaigns handbook page](/handbook/marketing/campaigns/). If you have any questions please post in the [#marketing_programs Slack channel](https://gitlab.slack.com/messages/CCWUCP4MS).

## Types of Virtual Events in GitLab

There are 6 different types of virtual events in GitLab.

* **Hosted demand gen webcast:** This is an internally hosted webcast geared towards generating net new leads or to nurture/educate existing prospects. Marketing programs normally own everything from the registration process, hosting the webcast on our webcast platform (zoom), all the way to post-event follow up.
* **Sponsored demand gen webcast:** This is webcast hosted on an external partner platform (e.g: DevOps.com) geared towards generating net new leads or to help push leads further down the sales funnel. We pay the partner a fee to host this webcast so they are responsible for driving registration, moderating and hosting the webcast on their platform. MOPs will be responsible for uploading the list to our database and MPMs will be responsible for sending post-event follow-up emails.
* **Account upsell webcast:**  This is an internally hosted webcast geared towards up-selling to an existing customer account. Marketing programs will work in collaboration with sales on the registration process. Marketing programs will also responsible for hosting the webcast on our webcast platform (zoom) and sending post-event follow-up emails.
* **Sponsored Virtual Conference:** This is not a webcast but rather a virtual conference where we pay a sponsorship fee to get a virtual booth and sometimes a speaking session slot. Marketing programs will primarily be responsible for sending the post-event follow-up emails.
* **Reseller enablement webcast:** This is an internally hosted webcast geared towards educating resellers on GitLab products/services as well as sales and marketing materials. Marketing programs will work in collaboration with the channel manager on the registration process. Marketing programs will also responsible for hosting the webcast on our webcast platform (zoom) and sending post-event follow-up emails.
* **Community webcast:** This is an internally hosted webcast driven by the community team to engage with GitLab user groups and community members. The community team is responsible for driving registration and sending post-event follow-up. The Marketing programs team supports the community team by hosting the webcast on our internal webcast platform (as needed).

## Below is a step by step guide on how to request Marketing Programs support for a virtual event.

**âš  Note: Virtual Event requests should be submitted no less than 45 business days before the event date so the new request can be added into the responsible Marketing Program Manager's (MPM) workflow and to ensure we have enough leeway for promotion time.**

#### Step 1: Create a [virtual event request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/digital-marketing-programs/blob/master/.gitlab/issue_templates/MPM_VirtualEvent_Request.md) in the digital marketing programs project.
*  Please use the `MPM_VirtualEvent_Request.md` issue template linked above
*  Please put the date of the virtual event as a due date
*  Please specify the type of virtual event
*  @ mention MPM in the issue comment to confirm the requested date is feasible
*  MPM will check the requested date against [the virtual events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2l0bGFiLmNvbV8xcXZlNmc4MWRwOTFyOWhldnRrZmQ5cjA5OEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) to make sure there is no overlapping virtual event that has been pre-scheduled
*  If the requested date is feasible and the speakers have been secured the Marketing Programs team will change the status label from `status:plan` to `status:wip`, add the `Webcast` label and applicable `FY..` label (to make sure this appears on the [webcast issue board](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/boards/922606?&label_name[]=Webcast))

#### Step 2: MPM will create the Virtual Event EPIC.
*  When "status:wip" is on the issue and necessary elements are documented, MPM creates epic for the virtual event.
*  Naming convention: [Virtual Event Name] - [3-letter Month] [Date], [Year]
*  MPM copy/pastes code below into the epic

```
## [Main Issue >>]()

## [GANTT >>]()

## [Copy for landing page and emails >>]() - [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j43mf7Lsq2AXoNwiygGAr_laiFzmokNCfMHi7KNLjuA/edit)

## Event Details
  * `place details from the event issue here`
  * [ ] [main salesforce campaign]()
  * [ ] [main marketo program]()

## Issue creation

* [ ] Secure presenters and dry runs issue created - MPM
* [ ] Only for Virtual sponsorship and 3rd Party Hosted webcast: List clean and upload issue created - MOps

cc @nlarue to create list upload issue (Only for Virtual sponsorship and 3rd Party Hosted webcast)

```

#### Step 3: MPM will create the necessary MPM support issues (linked in table below) and add to epic.
