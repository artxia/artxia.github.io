## What this page is for

This part of the handbook is for the blog editorial team. If this isn't you, you may find what you are looking for in the [blog handbook](/handbook/marketing/blog), which covers the process for opening an issue and merge request for your blog post, as well as getting reviewed and published.

## Blog style guide

We use American English by default.

### Acronyms

When using [acryonyms or initialisms](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/acronym-vs-initialism/),
ensure that your first mention uses the full term and includes the shortened
version in parentheses directly afterwards. From then on you
may use the acronym or initialism instead.

> Example: A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is the industry standard for open
source contributions to other projects.

Below are some common acronyms and initialisms we use which don't need to be
defined first (but use sparingly, see [Tone of voice](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#tone-of-voice) above):

- AFAIK - as far as I know
- ICYMI - in case you missed it (for social only)
- IIRC - if I recall correctly
- IRL - in real life
- TL;DR - too long; didn't read

### Ampersands

Use ampersands only where they are part of a company's name or the title of a
publication or similar. Example: Barnes & Noble

Do not use as a substitute for "and."

### Capitalization

See [below](#word-list) for styling of specific words.

#### Case

Use [sentence case](https://www.thoughtco.com/sentence-case-titles-1691944) for
all titles and headings.

#### Feature names

All GitLab feature names must be capitalized. If referring to a GitLab feature as part of a workflow rather than speaking about the feature itself, use lower case.

> Examples: "GitLab Issue Boards are a powerful project management and collaboration tool." vs "The editorial team uses an issue board to track the progress of blog posts."

#### Job titles

We do not capitalize job titles, regardless of whether they appear before or after a person's name.

#### GitLab functions/departments/teams

These are elements that make up GitLab the company's [organizational structure](/company/team/structure/#organizational-chart). Capitalize the name of the element, but not the word after:

> Example: Engineering function, Security department

#### Brand and publication names

Ensure you style brand names consistently with how the company does.

> Example: WiFi Tribe, DigitalOcean

The only exception to this is for brand names that are in all upper or lower case. Always capitalize the first letter, regardless of how it is styled in a company's logo.

> Examples: Reddit, Lego

If the word "the" forms part of a brand or publication's name, capitalize it:

> Examples: The Wall Street Journal, The Times

You can drop the "The" entirely if used as follows:

> "We spoke to a Wall Street Journal reporter"

### Contractions

We favor contractions ("can't," "didn't," "it's," "we're") to sound more human and
less formal.

### Dates

#### Months

Spell out, unless using the full date (see below).

#### Specific dates

Jan. 3, 2019 (abbreviate month, no `rd` after 3)

### Headlines

Headlines matter, both to the reader and when it comes to search engine optimization (SEO). Please craft a headline that tells the reader what your post is about using as few words as possible. The more specific a headline is, the better. Also, the more "prescriptive" the headline is – using words like "how," "why," or "what" for example – the more clear it is to the reader and to Google what the post is about. When all else fails, please put yourself in the position of the reader who is searching for something on Google (because that's the major way people find our blog). 

Try to avoid beginning with continuous verbs ("-ing"). Make them active and descriptive so that readers know what they can expect to gain from reading the post. Your headline and any subheadings don't need to be full sentences. Do not include a period at the end.

#### Example headlines

- A headline like "**How GitLab switched from Azure to GCP in 10 days**" clearly reflects what someone might be searching for: how to switch platforms, how to move from Azure, how to move to GCP, etc. 
  - "**Switching from Azure to GCP**" on the other hand is vague, because it's not clear who is doing the switching, or if the post is going to cover how to switch or why to switch.
- "**What's in your backpack?**" (an actual [post about tools for remote work](/blog/2019/10/10/whats-in-your-backpack/) isn't "findable" on SEO because it's not nearly specific enough. 
  - If the headline had been "**GitLab's top tools for remote work**" or "**GitLab's round up of top remote work tools**" it would have been much more likely to be discovered by someone searching on Google for remote work tools. Some more examples:
-  ~~Reducing DevOps costs~~ -> How to reduce DevOps costs
-  ~~Beautifying our UI~~ -> What we're doing to beautify our UI

If all this seems too much, we get it! And that's why the Editorial team will always review (and maybe tweak) your headline for SEO, style, and content. But, because you're writing a blog post as an SME (and we're not SMEs) we hope you'll put that expertise to work in the headline as much as possible. 

### Lists

Use `*` or `-` to create a bulleted list in Markdown. No period is necessary at the end of each bullet point.

### Numbers

Numbers with four or more digits should include a comma.

> Examples: 2,000; 100,000

#### In body copy

Spell out one to nine. Use numerals for 10 upwards. Try to avoid beginning a
sentence with a number, but if unavoidable, spell it out.

#### In headings/subheadings

Use numerals. If at the beginning of a heading, capitalize the first word following.

> Example: 3 Strategies for implementing a microservices architecture

### Pronouns

Unless referring to someone in particular, use gender-neutral pronouns ("they", "them").

### Punctuation

Only one space after a period is necessary.

Include one space after ellipses (... )

See [below](#word-list) for when to hyphenate specific words.

We use en dashes (–) rather than em dashes (—). Include a space before and after the dash.

Use % instead of "percent" at all times.

### Quotes

#### Quotation marks

Use double quotation marks for direct quotes, and single quotation marks for a quote within a quote. Single quotation marks may also be used for specialist terms or sayings.

- Include periods and commas inside ending quotation marks.
- Leave semi-colons, colons, and dashes outside of the quotation marks.
- Include other punctuation based on the sentence meaning.

Examples: 
> Recently, an article was published stating, "Software is eating the world."

> What do you think of the claim, "Software is eating the world"?

> "Do you agree that software is eating the world?" wrote the author.


#### Tense

When including direct quotations from interviewees in blog posts, we prefer to use the feature journalism style of present tense for verbs such as "said," "explained" etc.

> Example: "Ruby was optimized for the developer, not for running it in production," says Sid.

#### Referring to interviewees

For blog posts, prefer referring to interviewees by their first names as this is less formal and more in keeping with our [tone of voice](/handbook/marketing/corporate-marketing/#tone-of-voice).

### Voice

Active voice is preferred to passive voice in blog posts. *Voice* describes whether the subject of a sentence receives or performs the action of a verb.
> Example: "The GitLab community submitted 1 million merge requests in March 2019." (active) vs. "One million merge requests were submitted by the GitLab community in March 2019." (passive)

### Word choice

When in doubt, use the "future" styling of a word. So, "internet" is not capitalized,
"startup" is not hyphenated, etc.

- Agile
   - A is capitalized when referring to [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

spelling differences](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/british-and-spelling).

## SEO guidelines

Each blog post should be optimized for search engines. 

A primary keyword is a word/phrase that is repeated a few times in the blog post/headline (see below) and will help a search engine make our content "findable." A secondary keyword reinforces the first keyword by giving someone searching for content on the internet another way to find what they're looking for. In the spirit of MVC, let's focus on just making sure each blog post has a primary keyword (but you'll get bonus points if you can work a secondary keyword in!) A primary keyword might be "DevSecOps" while a secondary keyword might be "DevOps security tools" or "secure software development." Please note that while "keyword" is the commonly used term that does not mean it has to be a single word; it can certainly be a short phrase (also known as a long-tail keyword.)

We use [Moz Pro](https://www.moz.com), which is a straightforward way to search for keywords. You can enter a topic and then you'll get suggestions based on traffic volume. Choose a keyword and remember that often a long-tail version might work just as well and have less competition from other sources (example: DevSecOps vs. DevOps security tools). 

**In an ideal world, your keyword or keyword phrase should be in the URL, the headline and the first paragraph.** 

If some or all of that is not possible, alt-text for a photo, a caption or the tweet that appears on the bottom of the blog post are great ways to "sneak in" keywords.

If for some reason you don't have access to Moz or you're not finding anything that feels right, here's another more DIY SEO option.

1. Start with the main topic of the post (example: DevSecOps)
1. Visit [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com), enter your term and make sure to choose "worldwide." You can also enter other terms to compare it to (example: software development security). Scroll down and you'll see how popular your keyword is and you'll also be offered some alternate suggestions.
1. Consider your keyword in context. The term "DevOps" will be popular but that also means there will be a lot of competition for it. But a long-tail keyword like "DevOps security tools" will have less competition.
1. Once you've settled on a keyword it would be ideal, but not mandatory, to have it in the URL, headline and in the first paragraph.

Finally, digital marketing is putting together a searchable database of relevant keywords for GitLab that will be updated monthly. When that is ready a link will be available here.

## Editorial review checklist

### Style and language

- Does the post adhere to our style guide?
- Is it written in [American English](#appendix-b-uk-vs-american-english)?
- Are all titles and headlines in [sentence case](#case)?

### Formatting

- Is the filename all in lowercase, with no special characters or numbers other than the date?
- The filename will become the blog post URL when it is published. Does it make sense as the URL? Does it include the primary keyword for SEO?
- Does the filename reflect the publish date accurately? (final review only)
- Has all the relevant [frontmatter](/handbook/marketing/blog/#frontmatter) been included correctly?
- Has the correct [category](/handbook/marketing/blog/#categories) been entered? If not, the build will fail.
- Has `gitlab` been added to the `author_twitter` field if the author doesn't wish to use their own handle?
- Does the `Description` field copy fit on the tile on [/blog](/blog)?
- Is it appropriate to include a [trial CTA](/handbook/marketing/blog/#ee-trial-banner) on this post? Generally, if a post falls under `culture`, `engineering`, or `open source` it is best to remove it.
- Has the appropriate [merchandizing](/handbook/marketing/blog/#merch-banner-and-sidebar) been included and are the sidebar and banner rendering correctly?
- Are all [images formatted correctly](/handbook/marketing/blog#inline-images) and are they <1MB?
- Are any image filenames all in lower case, with no special characters or spaces?
- Does any of the images need a [caption](/handbook/marketing/blog#image-captions)?
- Check the file extension `.html.md.erb` and that the [newsletter sign-up form is included in the post](/handbook/marketing/blog/#newsletter-sign-up-form), if appropriate. Don't include it if there are other CTAs in the post (for example, directing people to sign up for a webcast or watch a video).
- Is there an [image credit](/handbook/marketing/blog#image-attribution), if needed?
- Does the click-to-tweet copy make sense? Could it include any other handles or hashtags? [Edit it](/handbook/marketing/blog/#twitter-text) if necessary.
- Do all links work?
- Are all about.gitlab.com [links relative](/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#relative-links)?
- [Wherever possible, does the text for links make sense out of context?](/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#links) Would someone only seeing that text know what to expect from the link if they click on it?

## Checklist for merging blog posts

When you are ready to merge a scheduled blog post, check the review app for the blog post:

![Link to review app](/images/handbook/marketing/link-to-review-app.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

- Is the date on the blog post correct?
- Are all images and formatting rendering as expected?
- Is the post likely to get a lot of attention/engagement/traffic? Is it about a hot-button topic like compensation or big industry news? Please give the community advocates a heads up in #community-advocates on Slack before you publish.

When you've checked all these, go ahead and hit `Merge`. You can also check the boxes for `Delete source branch` and `Squash commits` but this isn't strictly necessary.

![Merge button](/images/handbook/marketing/merge-button.png){: .shadow.medium.center}

Once you've pressed merge, go to the [Pipelines page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/pipelines), which you can find in the menu on the left under CI/CD.

![Shortcut to pipelines page](/images/handbook/marketing/shortcut-to-pipelines-page.png){: .shadow.small.center}

Find your merge pipeline, which will probably be near the top of the page. It will say `Merge branch 'your-branch-name' into 'master'`.

![Merge pipeline](/images/handbook/marketing/merge-pipeline.png){: .shadow.large.center}

You can watch its progress there. Depending on your notification settings, you may get an email when your pipeline passes, or if it fails.

### When your pipeline passes

Go to the [blog homepage](/blog) and your post should be visible there. Sometimes this takes a few minutes. When you see it, grab the link and share it in the #content-updates channel in Slack.

### What happens if my pipeline fails?

If a pipeline fails when you try to merge something, it is usually not something you have done wrong! You can retry it, but if it still doesn't work, it's probably quickest to get an answer by sharing your MR link in #mr-buddies or #questions on Slack.

## MR buddies

If you run into issues with your MR, pipeline, or Terminal, it's usually quickest to ask for help in the #mr-buddies, #git-help, or #questions channel on Slack (be sure to include a link to your MR!). If you don't get an answer that way, you can reach out to a [Merge Request Buddy](/handbook/general-onboarding/mr-buddies/). The following team members have volunteered to be called on for assistance. You can also search for "Merge Request Buddy" on the [team page](/company/team).

## Featuring Unfiltered posts

The Editorial team will monitor the GitLab Unfiltered blog for posts that are suitable for featuring on the branded blog on a weekly basis.

### Process for reviewing and featuring Unfiltered posts

Every Monday, a member of the Editorial team will read new Unfiltered posts published during the previous week and select any posts that are likely to perform well on the branded blog for a full editorial review.

#### Criteria for a featured post

- Post has >500 sessions already, according to the [Content Marketing dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/open/1NIxCW309H19eLqc4rz0S8WqcmqPMK4Qb), and/or
- Post has the [attributes of an historically successful blog post](/handbook/marketing/blog/#attributes-of-a-successful-blog-post)

This is not an exhaustive list of criteria, as the Editorial team member will also use their best judgment regarding what tends to perform well on the branded blog.

#### Review process

##### Issue

If an Unfiltered blog post has been identified as a good candidate for featuring, the Editorial team member should open an issue in the [gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/issues) with the title "Feature Unfiltered post: [title of Unfiltered post]", using the `feature-unfiltered-post` issue template.

Include a link to the original post in the issue description, and @ mention the author of the post so that they are aware it is being reviewed for featuring on the branded blog.

##### Merge request review

Once the issue is open, the Editorial team member can create an MR for the full editorial review of the post, in the same way as net new posts that are submitted to the branded blog for review.

**Checklist for reviewer:**

- Add the following statement to the top of the blog post file:

```
This blog post was originally published on the [GitLab Unfiltered blog](/blog/categories/unfiltered/). It was reviewed and republished on yyyy-mm-dd.
{: .alert .alert-info .note}
```
- Remove Unfiltered [disclaimers](/handbook/marketing/blog/unfiltered/#disclaimers) from top and bottom of blog post
-  Change [category](/handbook/marketing/blog/#categories) from `unfiltered` to another
- Keep filename the same. Do not update to the current date (this will change the URL for the blog post and result in a 404 for existing links to the original post)
- Assign the MR to the post's original author for review of any changes

When the author has reviewed and all outstanding threads resolved, they should reassign the MR to the Editorial team member to merge the changes.

##### Merging

Featured Unfiltered posts can be merged straight away, and don't need to be scheduled like brand new posts. When the edited post is live, the Editorial team member who merged should share a link in the #content-updates channel on Slack so the social team is aware that the post is now on the branded blog and can be shared on GitLab social channels.

The team will aim to have selected posts featured within a week of creating the issue. This may change depending on the availability of the post's author to review changes.
