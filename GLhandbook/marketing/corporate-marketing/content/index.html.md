## What does the Global Content Team do?

The Global Content section includes the content marketing, editorial, and digital production teams. It is responsible for content strategy, development, and operations, including the stewardship of GitLab's audiences, users, customers, and partners' content needs. The Global Content Team creates engaging, inspiring, and relevant content, executing integrated content programs to deliver useful and cohesive content experiences that build trust and preference for GitLab.

**Check the [FY21 Global Content Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/229) for more details on our plans and activities for FY21.**

### Adding an event to the editorial calendar

1. Make sure there is an associated issue for the event. Link the issue in the event description.
1. Always check "all day event" unless there is a specific time the piece should publish. This is rare and usually only if a blog post is tied to a time-sensitive PR announcement.
1. Name your event using the following nomenclature: <emoji, title of content, campaign>. Example: `üìù 5 Reasons to Use GitLab, Just Commit`

## Content production

The content team supports many cross-functional marketing initiatives. We aim for content production to be a month ahead of planned events and campaigns so that content is readily available for use. In accordance with our values of [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) and [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we publish our proposed content plans at the beginning of each quarter. We don't hoard content for one big launch and instead plan sets of content to execute on each quarter and published each piece of content as it's completed.

Content production is determined and prioritized based on the following:

1. Corporate GTM themes
1. Integrated campaigns
1. Corporate marketing events
1. Newsworthiness
1. Brand awareness opportunity

We align our content production to pillars and topics to ensure we're creating a cohesive set of content for our audience to consume. Pillar content is multi-purpose and can be plugged into integrated campaigns, event campaigns, and sales plays.

### Content alignment

Content production is aligned to digital campaigns and product messaging.

**Definitions**

- Campaign/Value driver: A high-level GTM message that doesn't change often. Campaigns are tracked as `Parent Epics`.  
- Pillar: A story within a theme. Pillars are tracked as `Child Epics`.
- Set: A topical grouping of content to be executed within a specific timeframe. Sets are tracked as `Milestones`.
- Resource: An informative asset, such as an eBook or report, that is often gated.

## Content stage / buyer's journey definitions

### Awareness (Top)
Users and buyers realize that they have a problem or challenge which could be solved through some sort of outside software or service.  At this stage, they are trying to define the scope and the relative impact and size of the problem.  They probably do not yet have a solution identified, but are in the process of learning about potential solutions to their specific business problem.

In general, messaging in collateral and content should be focused on **educating them about the problems they are facing, the business impact of their problems, and the reality that others are successfully solving the same problem**.  This is an opportunity for them to learn that GitLab is an authority in addressing their domains.

### Consideration (Middle)
Users and buyers understand the problem they are trying to solve and the business impact/value of addressing the problem and are now actively seeking and evaluating potential remedies to their business issue.  Typically, they will be considering a range of approaches from better leveraging existing tools to investing in new technologies and vendors.  In this stage they are focused on identifying options that meet their specific requirements and needs.  While cost will be a consideration, they have not yet made a final decision about how to address their needs.  In this stage, they will be defining their budget and overall plans for implementing a solution.

In general, collateral and content designed to reach prospects in this stage of their journey should be focused on **positioning GitLab as a viable and compelling solution to their specific problem**.  

### Decision/Purchase (Bottom)
Users and buyers have concluded that they need to invest in solving a specific business problem and are now comparing and evaluating specific options.  In this stage, they are evaluating and comparing different options in order to identify the ideal solution for their specific situation.  They will consider Fit (technology, process, etc), implementation effort/cost, total cost of ownership and other factors to guide them in making a final selection.  

In general, collateral and content designed to reach prospects in this stage of their journey should be focused on key information that a buyer needs to **justify GitLab as their chosen solution**.
