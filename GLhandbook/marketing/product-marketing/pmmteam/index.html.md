## Product marketing at GitLab

Product Marketing communicates GitLab business value internally and externally to position GitLab as a DevOps partner and solution. The team is responsible for product positioning, value messaging, and go-to-market strategy to support sales and outbound messaging with analysts, press, and prospects. Product Marketing also facilitates market feedback as key inputs into the GitLab product roadmap.

Specifically, product marketing develops and delivers messaging, positioning, and compelling collateral/content such as:
1. Web pages / digital content

1. Enablement for sales and partners

### Use cases  
[Customer 'use cases'](/handbook/use-cases/) are a customer problem or initiative that needs a solution and attracts budget, typically defined In customer terms.

1. Prioritize and refine existing or create new content.
1. Collaborate with the rest of the marketing groups (Marketing Program Management, Content Marketing, Digital Marketing, SDRs, etc.) to promote and measure GTM effectiveness.

### Stages and categories
DevOps stages and categories organize and define how we plan and engineer new GitLab features.   
1. Contribute to the stage and category vision.
1. Lead messaging for release posts and support feature descriptions.
1. Competitive research and comparisons.


The [Product Marketing - Overview Issue Board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/product-marketing/-/boards/1074672) is where we plan, manage, and track our work.

### Organization

Customer use cases are our primary focus, as we strive to communicate the value of GitLab and how it helps customers address specific challenges they are facing.  All of the GitLab stages and categories support various use cases in different degrees.  By focusing on Use Cases, we intend to remain connected to the market and our customers while educating them about how GitLab can solve their specific challenges.

In this model, Senior PMMs are responsible for both the collateral and messaging supporting a specific Use Case **and** also one or several stages. Detail stable counterparts assignments between product marketing and specific product groups is maintained in the [Product Categories page](/handbook/product/categories/#dev-section). PMMs support the team with messaging and go to market efforts, leading research, writing, and collateral development.

This model helps to define several stable counterpart relationships with the product and engineering teams, where specific use cases map to current sections in our hierarchy.

#### Release vs. launch
A [product release, and a marketing launch are two separate activities](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/dont-launch.html). The canonical example of this is Apple. They launch the iPhone at their yearly event and then release it months later. At GitLab we do it the other way: Release features as soon as they are ready letting customers use them right away, and then, do a marketing launch later when we have market validation.

| Release | Launch |
|-|-|
| PM Led | PMM Led |
| New features can ship with or without marketing support | Launch timing need not be tied to the proximity of when a feature was released |

##### Task cascading after release

Since at Gitlab we release [a lot](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/categories/releases/), [alot](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/) at Gitlab we ought to strive to communicate and promote whatever makes a difference to our community, our clients and the market at large. Regardless of what constitutes a launch – a consensus reached internally at the group level based on different reasons –  progressive delivery a la Gitlab requires that only categories or features that reach the maturity level of **viable** require the following marketing activity cascading:

| Does this release require a change in the Handbook? | [Update Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#handbook-guidelines) |
| Does this release require to update the Docs? | [Update Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/README.html#help-and-feedback) |
| Does this release require a edit of the publicly available marketing collateral? | [Edit the webiste](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/git-page-update/) | [Edit the website])(https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/getting-started/102/) |
| Does this release require a to update, edit or create new sales enablement? | [Schedule a session](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/training/sales-enablement-sessions/#scheduling-trainings) |
