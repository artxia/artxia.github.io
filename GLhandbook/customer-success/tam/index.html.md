## What is a Technical Account Manager (TAM)?

GitLab's Technical Account Managers serve as trusted advisors to GitLab customers. They offer guidance, planning and oversight during the technical deployment and implementation process. They fill a unique space in the overall service lifecycle and customer journey and actively bind together sales, solution architects, customer stakeholders, product management, Professional Services Engineers and support.

See the [Technical Account Manager role description](/job-families/sales/technical-account-manager/) for further information.

### Advocacy
A Technical Account Manager is an advocate for both the customer and GitLab. They act on behalf of customers serving as a feedback channel to development and shaping of the product. In good balance, they also advocate on behalf of GitLab to champion capabilities and features that will improve quality, increase efficiency and realize new value for our customer base. Quarterly, the TAM team meets to deliver a [Top 10 list](/handbook/customer-success/tam/cs-top-10) to the [Product](/handbook/product) team.
