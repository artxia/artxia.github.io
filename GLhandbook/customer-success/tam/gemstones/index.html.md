# Customer Onboarding & Gemstone Categorization

We should include a pre-defined set of professional services in each initial purchase. This aims to improve the customer onboarding experience across all customers while setting a precedent for how all customers are managed (with regards to outreach, support, technical account management etc) throughout the duration of their experience and relationship with GitLab.

Technical Account Managers and Professional Services Engineers should work closely together throughout the onboarding process, with support from Solutions Architects and Strategic Account Leaders/Account Managers where appropriate.

Please note that these gemstones are NOT intended to replace sales segmentation, they are a way of categorising customers in a way that's relevant to Customer Success.

Below is an outline of  the ideal onboarding experiences that we want to deliver for our customers based on deal size. This is intended to be included as part of the customer's GitLab purchase at some point in either Q1 or Q2 2019 (TBD) once we have enough headcount to deliver it. Expectations MUST be managed with the customer early on that anything outside of these strict boundaries must have a Statement of Work attached and be paid for before any of the additional work is delivered.

Customer onboarding is a 45 day time period. All implementation and training must be scheduled to be delivered within the first 30 days of purchase. The Technical Account Manager is responsible for ensuring that this happens.
