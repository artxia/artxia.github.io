### Key Discussion Points

*  Our [Mission](/company/strategy/#mission) is that Everyone Can Contribute, and our most important value is [Results](/handbook/values/#results). Like we've extended that to the Handbook, we want to extend it to our Learning Materials.
*  We want to leverage the best of an e-learning platform, with the benefits of reminders, interactivity, and more but make sure the materials we produce are also available to those who aren't using an e-learning platform, while fulfilling [our mission](/company/strategy/#mission). 
*  There are benefits to keeping our e-learning material [handbook-first](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first):
   * Folks who have already completed a formal training through an e-learning platform may want to return to the materials
   * Those who never go through the formal platform may also benefit from the materials
   * The handbook continues to be the SSOT, with the e-learning platform leveraging handbook materials through screenshots, embeds, and more

## Six Critical Questions
