## Specific to India based employees

All of the benefits listed below are administered and managed by [Lyra Infosystems](http://lyrainfo.com/). As part of the onboarding process Lyra will reach out to team members in their first week to arrange setup and enrollment.  Should you have any questions about these benefits please contact hr@lyrainfo.com or the People Operations Compensation Team at GitLab who are also very happy to assist.

## Medical Benefits

Should additional cover be required this will need to be purchased by the team member in the form of an Individual Policy. This can not be purchased under the Group Mediclaim Policy.

## Pension

LYRA has a provident fund that the employees pay to the government. This is included in the CTC. Currently, the employer pay 11% of the basic salary as a statutory requirement.

## Life Insurance

Most companies in India do not offer life insurance as part of the benefits package. LYRA, similarly, does not offer a life insurance plan to GitLab team members. Most workers in India will typically get their own life insurance which can be portable throughout their lifetime.

## Meal Vouchers

Zeta Meal Cards are an optional employee purchased benefit. These Meal Cards work like a Debit Card, which can be used at any outlet selling food items and non-alcoholic beverages that accept card payments. If you would like purchase these a deduction from salary will be made each month.
