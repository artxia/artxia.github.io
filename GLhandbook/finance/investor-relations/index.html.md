## Trading Window

We anticipate that our quarterly trading window will open the third trading day after the announcement of our quarterly results and that it will close again immediately prior to the last four weeks of the fiscal quarter, as indicated by an announcement made by the CLO. However, it is important to note that any quarterly trading window may be cut short if the CLO determines that material nonpublic information exists in such a fashion that it would make trades by directors, employees, and consultants inappropriate.

## Performance Indicator

Enterprise Value to Sales compares the enterprise value (EV) of a company to its annual sales.
