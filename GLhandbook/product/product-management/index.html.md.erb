## Product Team Mission

Consistently create products and experiences that customers love and value.

Additional color:

* Consistency wins as you scale.  The organizational goal is to create a PM system that maximizes the chances of success across new products, new features, and new team members.
* Remember, you’re shipping an experience, and not just a product.  Don’t forget about the links between the product and the website, pricing & packaging, documentation, sales, support, etc.
* It’s about your customers and doing a job for them, not the product itself.  Think externally about customer problems, not internally about the technology.
* Remember it’s about love AND value.  Will customers value what we are building?  We need to make sure what we build helps build and extract customer value.

## Product development

### Structure
Our [Product groups](/company/team/structure/#product-groups) are [assigned categories within a DevOps stage](/handbook/product/categories/).

### Categorization
Our product development hierarchy (sections, stages, groups and categories) are categorized by [maturity](/direction/maturity), [lifecycle](/direction/maturity) and [investment thesis](#investment-thesis).

#### Investment thesis
All product investments need to generate a version of ROI, which can be measured in one of two ways. 
The principle form of measurement is IACV, which is the most important metric in the company. 
The formula for measuring a feature’s effect on IACV can be: `AMAU ÷ AMAU total across all actions * ARR`. 
Where a feature is not generating IACV, 
we measure its ROI through its product usage, as measured by `AMAU ÷ SMAU for that stage`

Example: I make a new feature, and that action is taken by 1 million users.
Across all of GitLab, we have 100 million SMAU and we have 1 billion AMAU; 0.10%  of our ARR can be attributed to the feature I made.
If you have a lot of usage in a stage, it may generate revenue and we can consider impact to IACV.
If we do not have a lot of usage in stage we want to be looking at the users using it as a percentage of users using the stage to drive interest in that stage.
The example here is having a feature with a 18,000 AMAU on a 20,000 SMAU stage.
If 90% of the stages users are using the feature, we clearly made it more attractive and it will help to grow SMAU over time.


### Direction
Our product wide, section, stage and category direction pages can be found from our [Direction](/direction) page.

## Product Team Principles

These are core principles we believe strongly in.  The goal is to build a PM system that fosters and honors these principles, in a way that works for GitLab.

1. Hiring is Job 1.  A players attract A players.  Given the strategic importance of the PM role, a strong PM creates enormous leverage.  We should strive to raise the average competency for the team with each new hire.

1. Care personally & challenge directly.  Employees that feel safe plus managers that coach honestly is how people do their best work.  We encourage timely and actionable feedback, as well as managers that take the time to get to know their people as humans with feeling and personal lives, not just resources.

1. Always be learning.  Continuously invest in skill development, and have a growth mindset as individuals and as a team.

1. You’re not the customer.  Talk to them.  It is tempting to assume that we understand our customers, but we are often wrong.  We validate our assumptions through qualitative and quantitative customer input.

[Get in the Van](https://firstround.com/review/the-power-of-interviewing-customers-the-right-way-from-twitters-ex-vp-product/).
1. Start with the problem, not the solution.  It is tempting to dive right into solutioning, but we are often wrong about the underlying problem.  A well formed problem statement is the key to a successful project.

1. Prioritize ruthlessly.  It is better to do a few things well than many things poorly. We should focus first on what we’re best at and what our customers need most, with a preference for simplicity. Customers will tell us when we’re missing something they need, but they’re unlikely to tell us when we’re overwhelming them with unwanted features.

1. Assume you are wrong.  Human intuition is often wrong.  To fight this, have a hypothesis & try to invalidate it quickly.
  * Helpful resource:  [Thinking, Fast & Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_3?crid=CT91NU8162ED&keywords=thinking%2C+fast+and+slow&qid=1558392435&s=gateway&sprefix=thinking%2C+fas%2Caps%2C169&sr=8-3)
1. Iterate.  Leverage a fast-paced build-measure-learn feedback loop to iterate your way to a good solution, rather than trying to plan it all out up front.

1. Be data driven.  Always have success metrics, track them, and try to move them in the right direction with our actions.

## Interviewing Product Management Candidates

A unique and important step in the interview process for Product Management candidates is our Deep Dive Interview. The goal of this interview is to understand the candidate's ability to communicate a long term vision as well as a short term MVC, both verbally during the interview itself, and written via two follow up issues. Once the issues are ready for you to read, it is an opportunity to provide feedback and see how the candidate responds to that feedback.

You can find more information and instructions on the Deep Dive interview [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-group/hiring-processes/blob/master/Product/DeepDive.md). For information on our hiring process, head over to our [hiring handbook pages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/).                                                                                                        |
