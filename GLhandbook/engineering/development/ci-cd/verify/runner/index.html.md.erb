## Vision

For an understanding of what this team is going to be working on take a look at [the product
vision](/direction/verify/).

## Mission

The Verify:Runner Group is focused on all the functionality with respect to
Runner.

This team maps to [Verify](/handbook/product/categories/#verify-stage) devops stage.

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Verify:Runner group:

<%= direct_team(manager_role: 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Runner') %>

## Stable Counterparts

The following members of other functional teams are our stable counterparts:

<%= stable_counterparts(role_regexp: /[,&] Verify/, direct_manager_role: 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Runner', other_manager_roles: ['Frontend Engineering Manager, Verify', 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Continuous Integration', 'Engineering Manager, Verify:Testing']) %>

## Technologies

We spend a lot of time working in Go which is the language that [GitLab Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner) is written in. Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes is also useful on our team.

## Becoming a maintainer for one of our projects

We follow the same process [outlined
here](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#how-to-become-a-maintainer).
Any engineeer inside of the organization is welcome to become a
maintainer of a project owned by the Runner team. The first step would
be to become a [trainee
maintainer](/handbook/engineering/workflow/code-review/#trainee-maintainer).
