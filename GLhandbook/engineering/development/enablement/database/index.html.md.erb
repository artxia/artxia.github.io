## Vision

Developing solutions for scalability, application performance, data growth and developer enablement especially where it concerns interactions with the database.   

## Mission

Focusing on the database, our mission is to provide solutions that allow us to scale to our customer's demands.  To provide tooling to proactively identify performance bottlenecks to inform developers early in the development lifecycle.  To increase the number of database maintainers and provide database best practices to the community contributors and development teams within GitLab.

## Team Members

The following people are permanent members of the Database Team:

## Meetings

Whenever possible, we prefer to communicate asynchronously using issues, merge requests, and Slack. However, face-to-face meetings are useful to establish personal connection and to address items that would be more efficiently discussed synchronously such as blockers.

* Weekly Team Meeting every Monday at 8:00 AM PST (4:00 PM GMT)
* Weekly Database Office Hours held every other Thursday at 2:00PM GMT

## Work

We follow the GitLab [engineering workflow](/handbook/engineering/workflow/) guidelines.  To bring an issue to our attention please create an issue in the relevant project.  Add the `~"group::database"` label along with any other relevant labels.  If it is an urgent issue, please reach out to the Product Manager or Engineering Manager listed in the [Stable Counterparts](/handbook/engineering/development/enablement/database/#stable-counterparts) section above.
