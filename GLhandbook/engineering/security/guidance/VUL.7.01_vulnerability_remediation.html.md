# VUL.7.01 - Vulnerability Remediation

## Control Statement

GitLab assigns a risk rating to identified vulnerabilities and prioritizes remediation of legitimate vulnerabilities according to the assigned risk.

## Context

It is not reasonable for GitLab to patch 100% of vulnerabilities every day so we need a method to prioritize the remediation. Since the goal of this remediation is to reduce to the risk to the organization, we should perform this prioritization by risk which starts with assigning risk to vulnerabilities as they are identified. This prioritization and remediation is among the best way to reduce risk to GitLab's customers and reputation since unresolved vulnerabilities are among the most common attacks to organizations.

## Scope

This control applies to all systems within our production environment. The production environment includes all endpoints and cloud assets used in hosting GitLab.com and its subdomains. This may include third-party systems that support the business of GitLab.com.


## Ownership

Control Owner:

* Security Operations

Process Owner:

* Security Operations
* Infrastructure

## Guidance

* In order to prove the efficacy of this control, we need to build timelines of vulnerabilities.
* In order to build the above timelines, we will need ongoing scanning of production systems to know what software they are running compared against known vulnerabilities.
* This is generally among the most difficult controls to prove effectively since we need to have a near-perfect process in place and maintain that process over time.

## Additional control information and project tracking

Non-public information relating to this security control as well as links to the work associated with various phases of project work can be found in the [Vulnerability Remediation control issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance/compliance/issues/948).
