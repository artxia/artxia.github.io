# GitLab's Security Controls

Security controls are a way to state our company's position on a variety of security topics. It's not enough to simply say "We encrypt data" since our customers and teams will naturally want to know "what data do we encrypt?" and "how do we encrypt that data?". When all of our established security controls are operating effectively this creates a security program greater than the sum of its parts that will demonstrate to our stakeholders that GitLab has a mature and comprehensive security program that will provide assurance that data within GitLab is reasonably protected.

## GitLab Control Framework (GCF)

We have tried to take a comprehensive approach to our immediate and future security compliance needs. Older and larger companies tend to treat each security compliance requirement individually which results in independent security compliance teams going out to internal teams with multiple overlapping requests. For example, at such a company you might have one database engineer that is asked to provide evidence of how a particular database is encrypted based on SOC2 requirements, then again for ISO requirements, then again for PCI requirements. This approach can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    SOC2_Requirement1-->Team1;
    SOC2_Requirement1-->Team2;
    SOC2_Requirement2-->Team1;
    SOC2_Requirement2-->Team2;
    PCI_Requirement1-->Team1;
    ISO_Requirement1-->Team2;
```

Given our [efficiency value](/handbook/values/#efficiency) here at GitLab we wanted to create a set of security controls that would address multiple underlying requirements with a single security control which would allow us to make fewer requests of our internal teams and efficiently collect all evidence we would need for a variety of audits at once. This approach can be visualized as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    SOC2_Requirement1-->GCF;
    SOC2_Requirement2-->GCF;
    PCI_Requirement1-->GCF;
    ISO_Requirement1-->GCF;
    GCF-->Team1;
    GCF-->Team2;
```

Adobe's [open source compliance framework](https://blogs.adobe.com/security/2017/05/open-source-ccf.html) served as the starting point for this efficient method of collecting security control evidence. It has been adapted and expanded as needed and the result is the below list of controls grouped by families and sub-families. 

Clicking a control below that has a link will take you to a page with a variety of information about that control.

## Control Prioritization

There are a number of controls without links due to the way that GitLab has prioritized the documentation of all of these controls. A control without a link should not be taken to mean that GitLab is not in compliance with a specific controlâ€™s requirements, but rather that we are not yet tracking evidence of the operation of that control. Supporting documentation for all controls will be built out as we continue to iterate on our compliance program and pursue additional compliance certifications. 

## Control Ownership

Control Owner - Ensures that the design of the control and the control activities operate effectively and is responsible for remediation of any control activities that are required to bring that control into a state of audit-readiness.

Process Owner - Supports the operation of the control and carries out the process designed by the control owner. The process owner is most likely to be interviewed by an auditor to determine whether or not the process is operating as intended.

## What is considered `Production`?

The production environment includes all endpoints and cloud assets used in hosting GitLab.com and its subdomains. This may include third-party systems that support the business of GitLab.com.

## PCI Segmentation

Determining how a system may interact with the payment processing system is important when defining which systems are in-scope for Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance.  The following diagram demonstrates in-scope (connected-to) vs. out-of-scope (not connected-to) when defining the PCI environment:

```mermaid
graph TB

  SubGraph2Flow
  subgraph "Out-of-Scope B"
  SubGraph2Flow(System D)
  end

  SubGraph1Flow
  subgraph "Out-of-Scope A"
  SubGraph1Flow(System C)
  end

  subgraph "In-Scope for PCI"
  Node1[Payment Processing System] --> Node2[Connected-To System A]
  Node1[Payment Processing System] --> Node3[Connected-To System B]
  Node2 --> SubGraph1Flow(System C)
  Node3 --> SubGraph2Flow(System D)
end
```
**Please Note:**
*  *Connected-to systems create a buffer for the out-of-scope systems from directly connecting to the payment processing system.*
*  *It does not matter where a system resides (i.e. different cloud environment), if it communicates with the payment processing system, it is in-scope for PCI.*

## Data Classification Policy

For GitLab's data classification policy, please refer to the [data classification page](./data-classification-policy.html).

## Security Controls Feedback

If you have any feedback on any of the security controls or related documentation, please add it as a comment in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance/compliance/issues/218).

## Security Control Changes

The GitLab compliance team is responsible for ensuring the consistency of the documentation of the security controls listed below. While normally we welcome any GitLab team-member to make edits to handbook pages, please be aware that even small changes to the wording of any of these controls impacts how they satisfy the requirements for the security frameworks they map to. Because of this, we ask any changes that need to be made to this page and the underlying guidance pages to start with a comment in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/compliance/compliance/issues/219). The compliance team will then engage with you and make any appropriate changes to these handbook pages.
