## Board Renewal Process

The board as a whole determines which class each director will be a part of.
Assuming three classes, director can belong to class 1, class 2 or class 3.
Some directors will be in class 1 and will be up for reelection as soon as 1 year after [going public](/handbook/being-a-public-company/), while others will not be up for reelection until 3 years after going public.
Typically the decision as to who will go into which class of director is done very close to the IPO.

The decision is based on the preferences of all the directors as to when they would prefer to leave the board.

For example, some VC directors may prefer to leave the board earlier in the
process as they may liquidate their positions over the couple of years
following the IPO.

### Presentation

1. Put information on public webpages such as [/strategy](/company/strategy/) as much as possible.
1. Financial information and other non public items go into a shared Google Presentation which should not exceed 10 slides per function.
1. You can link to additional details. Please make sure that it is clear which content contains a hyperlink to additional materials.

### Functional memo

Each functional exec writes a one page memo to the board as a preface to the materials.
The materials in the deck should support the memo and not provide a series of interesting-but-not-core data points.
The memo should consist of:

1. What's the coolest thing their team did that the board should know?
1. What's the one thing that didn't work out as planned- a key hire who didn't accept, a product feature that has been delayed, a team that needs to get better aligned, an industry analyst who doesn't get it?
1. Have 1-3 things you would like input on. Ask yourself: what would give the board some color and also help other teams know where I could use some help?
1. This memo can be inspired by [MD&A documents](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/mda-management-discussion-analysis/) since those do a great job of providing a narrative, enriching data with anecdotes, and discuss the quality of ongoing projects and initiatives.

    ## Overview and Outlook
    (Summary of the quarter. Where you’re coming from, where you’re going, should also mention performance against KPIs.)
    ## Biggest Highlight
    (What's the coolest thing your team did that the board should know?)
    ## Unplanned wrinkle
    (What's the one thing that didn't work out as planned- a key hire who didn't accept, a product feature that has been delayed, a team that needs to get better aligned, an industry analyst who doesn't get it?)
    ## Situation 1
    (Have 1-3 things you would like input on. Ask yourself: what would give the board some color and also help other teams know where I could use some help?)
    I would like to sell pink potatoes but today I can only get them in gold, brown, and green. This is a problem because customers tell us that they’d pay a 4x premium for pink potatoes even with no other changes. We have the opportunity to increase IACV but 20% by something something
    ### Options
    We could grow our own pink potatoes but they take a long time to grow and harvest. Alternatively, we could negotiate with existing vendors, but need to be careful to not get ourselves in a difficult position with those vendors.
    ### Risks and Considerations
    We don’t even know that we have the skill sets internally to grow potatoes since they’re currently externally sourced. Trying to take this on puts us in a difficult position.

### CEO video

The CEO will make a video before the board meeting in the style of an earnings call.
This is to give a general overview of what is working and what is not.
This will be uploaded to YouTube as an unlisted video.
The Chief of Staff is responsible for coordinating this and ensuring it gets distributed to the Board with the other materials.

### Deep dives

Deep dives are the only functions with greater than 10 slides. 

There will be two deep dives on the agenda for each board meeting:

1. 30 minutes allotted to a single functional area on a rotational basis
1. 30 minutes allotted to a topic(s) of strategic or operational importance to the Company.

The functional deep dive rotation schedule is as follows:
* people (2020-03)
* product management and product strategy (2020-06)
* finance (2020-09)
* legal (2020-12)
* engineering (2021-03)
* sales (2021-06)
* marketing (2021-09)

Functional deep dives cover the following:
* Highlights over the last quarter (How we got here)
   * Additional details on each highlight
* Major Wins (in case there's anything worth mentioning that is a win, but might not be a highlight)
* Key Challenges
   * Additional details on each key challenge
* Upcoming Budget
   * Budget overview
   * Intent for budget
   * Themes for investment
* Initiatives and What to expect in the next quarter (peak to year)
* OKRs
   * Past quarter OKRs & Results
   * Next quarter OKRs & Results
* Function KPIs 
* Capabilities and Org Structure

### Agenda

1. We try to avoid presentations during the meeting, but there are two presentations at all Board Meetings:
   * 3 minutes for the single functional area
   * 5-10 minutes for Board Committee readouts accompanied by a bullet point list prepared by the Exec supporting the committee, highlighting the items requiring Board approval
1. Presentations can be made in response to questions.
1. The agenda could/should identify the topics as advisory or decision. Topics are clearly marked, each get a time allotment, five minutes unless otherwise approved.
1. The Chief of Staff groups topics and questions that are related together in the agenda.
1. Committee items should go early in the meeting, so that the committee chairs can describe their work, as it's best to get these out of the way early. Occasions where approval is required, like compensation, goals, exec equity, etc, can take more time, and it's best to get it done while folks are fresh.
1. Board members are encouraged to put their questions in a shared Google Doc before the meeting and the e-group will try to provide answers in advance of the board meeting as much as is practical.
1. Board members are assumed to have studied the shared Google Presentation (but not any materials linked from this presentation which are optional to study).
1. The whole [e-group](/handbook/leadership/#e-group) tries to be present for the meeting.
1. There is a closed session at the end to cover administrative items titled "Administrative Session" and attended by the CFO and CLO, and there is a closed board-only discussion that includes, among other things, reviewing the state of the executive team, and concludes with a top focus-area discussion with the CEO.

### Location

The board meeting is [all-remote](/company/culture/all-remote/) because half remote is a bad experience for remote participants, see [video calls](/handbook/communication/#video-calls) point 10.
